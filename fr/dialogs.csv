dlga_port_chief2:port_chief3|What do you need?{***};;
dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_buy_ship|I want to buy a ship.{***};;
dlga_port_chief_buy_ship:close_window|Follow me!{***};;
dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_info_main|I have some questions about ships and sea travel.{***};;
dlga_port_chief_info_main:port_chief_info_main_1|What do you want to know?{***};;
dlga_port_chief_info_main_1:port_chief_info_a_1|Why do people go to sea?{***};;
dlga_port_chief_info_main_1:port_chief_info_b_1|How do I find my way at sea?{***};;

dlga_port_chief_info_main_1:port_chief2|That's all I wanted to know. Thanks!{***};;
dlga_port_chief_info_a_1:port_chief_info_main|You can earn a lot of money if you trade goods or slaves across the sea. Others use it for raiding settlements. Finally, no Ironborn will respect you as a leader if you don't have a good ship.{***};;
dlga_port_chief_info_a_1:port_chief_info_main.1|You can earn a lot of money if you trade goods or slaves across the sea. Others use it for raiding settlements.{***};;
dlga_port_chief_info_b_1:port_chief_info_main|Look at the sun at day. Rest at night. The better you are at finding your way, the faster you travel.{***};;
dlga_port_chief_info_c_1:port_chief_info_c_2|First, you need to know what type of ship you want. If you want to trade, then a Merchant ship may be a good choice. They have much room for cargo, but they are not very fast. The Warship, the Galley and the Cog are fast warships and are able to carry many troops. The longship is something in-between. If you only have a few men and little coin, then just a small row boat would perhaps suit you better.{***};;
dlga_port_chief_info_c_2:port_chief_info_main|The second important factor is the type of wood the ship is made from. Ships made out of oak wood are the best ships, but are also expensive. Beech is cheaper, but it rots faster.{***};;
dlga_port_chief_info_d_1:port_chief_info_main|The wind -- if you place your sails in a position to catch it best. If there is no wind at all, then your crew has to row. More rowers will make the ship faster. If you have more than one ship in your fleet, then your fleet will only be as fast as your slowest ship. A skilled Navigator can also make your fleet faster.{***};;
dlga_port_chief3:port_chief_travel|I want to travel to another port.{***};;
dlga_port_chief_travel:close_window|I'm sorry. There are currently no passenger ships in this port that can transport a marshal and his whole army.{***};;

dlga_start:fighter_talk|Hello there. We're polishing off our combat skills here with a bit of sparring practice. You look like you could use a bit of training. Why don't you join us? We could show you a few tricks. And if you need explanation of any combat concepts, just ask, and I'll do my best to fill you in.{***};;
dlga_start:fighter_talk.1|What do you want to practice?{***};;
dlga_fighter_pretalk:fighter_talk|Tell me what kind of practice you want.{***};;
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_attack|I want to practice attacking.{***};;
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_parry|I want to practice blocking with my weapon.{***};;
dlga_fighter_talk:fighter_talk_train_combat|Let's do some sparring practice.{***};;
dlga_fighter_talk:close_window|[Leave]{***};;
dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack:fighter_talk_train_attack_2|All right. There are four principle directions for attacking. These are overhead swing, right swing, left swing and thrust. Now, I will tell you which direction to attack from, and you must try to do the correct attack. ^^(Move your mouse while you press the left mouse button to specify attack direction. For example, to execute an overhead attack, move the mouse up at the instant you press the left mouse button. The icons on your screen will help you do the correct action.){***};;
dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack_2:close_window|Let's begin then. I'm ready.{***};;
dlga_fighter_talk_train_attack_2:fighter_pretalk|Actually I want to do something else.{***};;
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry:fighter_talk_train_parry_2|Unlike a shield, blocking with a weapon can only stop attacks coming from one direction. For example, if you block up, you'll deflect overhead attacks, but you can still be hit by side swings or thrust attacks. ^^(You must press and hold down the right mouse button to block.){***};;
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_2:fighter_talk_train_parry_3|I'll now attack you with different types of strokes, and I'll wait until you do the correct block before attacking. Try to do the correct block as soon as you can. ^^(This practice is easy to do with the 'automatic block direction' setting which is the default. If you go to the options menu and change defend direction control to 'mouse movement' or 'keyboard', you'll need to manually choose block direction. This is much more challenging but also makes the game more interesting. This practice can be very useful if you use manual blocking.){***};;
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_3:close_window|Let's begin then. I'm ready.{***};;
dlga_fighter_talk_train_parry_3:fighter_pretalk|Actually I want to do something else.{***};;
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat:fighter_talk_train_combat_2|Sparring is an excellent way to prepare for actual combat. We'll fight each other with non-lethal weapons now, until one of us falls to the ground. You can get some bruises of course, but better that than being cut down in the real thing.{***};;
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat_2:close_window|Let's begin then. I'm ready.{***};;
dlga_fighter_talk_train_combat_2:fighter_pretalk|Actually I want to do something else.{***};;
dlga_start:fighter_parry_try_again|Good. You were able to block my attacks successfully. You may repeat this practice and try to get faster each time, until you are confident of your defence skills. Do you want to have another go?{***};;
dlga_start:fighter_parry_try_again.1|Well, that didn't go too well, did it? (Remember, you must press and hold down the right mouse button to keep your block effective.) Do you want to try again?{***};;
dlga_fighter_parry_try_again:fighter_talk_train_parry|Yes. Let's try again.{***};;
dlga_fighter_parry_try_again:fighter_talk_leave_parry|No, I think I'm done for now.{***};;
dlga_start:fighter_parry_warn|Hey! We're doing a blocking practice, mate! You're supposed to block my attacks, not attack me back.{***};;
dlga_fighter_parry_warn:fighter_talk_train_parry|I'm sorry. Let's try once again.{***};;
dlga_fighter_parry_warn:fighter_talk_leave_parry|Sorry. I must leave this practice now.{***};;
dlga_fighter_talk_leave_parry:close_window|All right. As you wish.{***};;
dlga_start:fighter_combat_try_again|Well, that didn't go too well, did it?  Don't feel bad, and try not to do same mistakes next time. Do you want to have a go again?{***};;
dlga_fighter_combat_try_again:fighter_talk_train_combat|Yes. Let's do another round.{***};;
dlga_fighter_combat_try_again:fighter_talk_leave_combat|No. That was enough for me.{***};;
dlga_fighter_talk_leave_combat:close_window|Well, all right. Talk to me again if you change your mind.{***};;
dlga_start:fighter_combat_try_again.1|Hey, that was good sparring. You've defeated me, but next time I'll be more careful. Do you want to have a go again?{***};;
dlga_start:fighter_talk.2|Very good. You've learned how to attack from any direction you want. If you like, we can try this again or move to a different exercise.{***};;
dlga_start:archer_challenge_2|Not bad. Not bad at all! You seem to have grasped the basics of archery. Now, try to do the same thing with a crossbow. Take the crossbow and the bolts over there and shoot those three targets. The crossbow is much easier to shoot with compared with the bow, but you need to reload it after each shot.{***};;
dlga_start:archer_challenge_2.1|Good. You didn't have too much difficulty using the crossbow either. Next you will learn to use throwing weapons. Pick up the javelins you see over there and try to hit those three targets. {***};;
dlga_start:ranged_end|Well, with that you have received the basic skills to use all three types of ranged weapons. The rest will come with practice. Train each and every day, and in time you'll be as good as the best marksmen in Westeros and Essos.{***};;
dlga_ranged_end:close_window|Now you can go talk with the melee fighters or the horsemanship trainer if you haven't already done so. They can teach you important skills too.{***};;
dlga_start:archer_talk|Good day to you, young fellow. I spend my days teaching about ranged weapons to anyone that is willing to learn. If you need a tutor, let me know and I'll teach you how to use the bow, the crossbow or the javelin.{***};;
dlga_archer_talk:archer_challenge|Yes, show me how to use ranged weapons.{***};;
dlga_archer_talk:close_window|No, not now.{***};;
dlga_archer_challenge:archer_challenge_2|All right. Your first training will be in archery. The bow is a difficult weapon to master. But once you are sufficiently good at it, you can shoot quickly and with great power. Go pick up the bow and arrows you see over there now and shoot those targets.{***};;
dlga_archer_challenge_2:close_window|All right. I'm ready.{***};;
dlga_archer_challenge_2:close_window.1|Just a minute. I want to do something else first.{***};;
dlga_start:horseman_melee_challenge_2|I hope you've enjoyed the ride. Now we move on to something a bit more difficult. Grab the lance you see over there and ride around the course hitting each target at least once.{***};;
dlga_start:horseman_melee_challenge_2.1|Good! You have been able to hit all targets on horseback. That's no easy feat for a starter. Your next challenge will be using a bow and arrows to shoot at the archery targets by the road. You need to put an arrow to each target to consider yourself successful.{***};;
dlga_start:horsemanship_end|Very good. You were able to shoot all targets from horseback. Keep riding and practising each day and in time you will be an expert horseman.{***};;
dlga_horsemanship_end:close_window|Now you can go talk with the melee fighters or the archery trainer if you haven't already done so. You need to learn everything you can to be prepared when you have to defend yourself.{***};;
dlga_start:horseman_talk|Good day! I have come here for some riding practice, but my old bones are aching badly so I've decided to give myself a rest today. If you would like to practice your horsemanship, you can take my horse here. The exercise would be good for her.{***};;
dlga_horseman_talk:horseman_challenge|Yes, I would like to practice riding.{***};;
dlga_horseman_talk:close_window|Uhm. Maybe later.{***};;
dlga_horseman_challenge:horseman_melee_challenge_2|Good. Now I'll give you a few exercises that'll teach you riding and horseback weapon use. Your first assignment is simple. Just take your horse for a ride around the course. Go as slow or as fast as you like. Come back when you feel confident as a rider and I'll give you some tougher exercises.{***};;
dlga_horseman_melee_challenge_2:close_window|All right. I'm ready.{***};;
dlga_horseman_melee_challenge_2:close_window.1|Just a minute. I need to do something else first.{***};;
dlga_tutorial_troop_default:close_window|Hey, I'm trying to practice here. Go, talk with the archery trainer if you need guidance about ranged weapons.{***};;
dlga_start:lord_prison_break_confirm_3|Is there a change of plans?{***};;
dlga_start:lord_prison_break|What's going on?{***};;
dlga_start:drunk_response|What are you looking at?{***};;
dlga_start:drunk_response.1|Are you looking at me?{***};;
dlga_player_duel_response:close_window|Such a waste.{***};;
dlga_player_duel_response:close_window.1|Better him than me.{***};;
dlga_drunk_response:drunk_fight_start|I'm not sure. Some sort of animal, clearly.{***};;
dlga_drunk_response:drunk_fight_start.1|Sorry - please accept my apologies.{***};;
dlga_drunk_fight_start:close_window|I'll wipe that smirk right off your face!{***};;
dlga_drunk_response:drunk_player_high_renown|Do you have any idea who I am?{***};;
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_fight_start|Do I care?{***};;
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_player_high_renown|Ermmm... actually... yes, yes, I do know who you are, {ser/madame}. Please forgive me, your grace, it must be the drink. I'll be leaving, now...{***};;
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:drunk_fight_start.1|Why, if you want a fight, you shall have one!{***};;
dlga_drunk_player_high_renown:close_window|I thought as much. Now remove yourself from here!{***};;
dlga_start:fistfight_response|You look like a {fellow/lady} who can take a few hard knocks - and deal them out as well. I've a business proposition for you.{***};;
dlga_fistfight_response:fistfight_response_2|How's that?{***};;
dlga_fistfight_response_2:fistfight_response_2a|Good - I'm glad you're interested, {lad/lassie}. Here's the plan: it's a little complicated, so listen well. {***};;
dlga_fistfight_response_2a:fistfight_response_3|You and this other fellow will start up a fight here. No weapons, no armour. I'll sit back, take bets, and split the profits with the winner. If we make a loss, then I'll cover it. You've got nothing to lose, except a bit of blood, of course.{***};;
dlga_fistfight_response_3:fistfight_response_4|However, we can't organize this like one of those nice arena bouts where everyone places their bets beforehand. People will walk in, drawn by the noise, and put a silver stag or two on whichever one of you two they think is winning. I'll give 'em even odds. Anything else is going to be too tricky for someone who's already on his third flagon of ale.{***};;
dlga_fistfight_response_4:fistfight_response_4a|As you can see, the trick is to stretch things out for as long as possible where it looks like you're losing, so people bet against you. Then you come back fast and win before the betting can turn. The best way to make money is for you to be battered almost to the floor and then jump back off your feet and take the other guy down. But don't forget it, {lad/lassie}, you have to win in the end in order for me, and you, to make money.{***};;
dlga_fistfight_response_4a:fistfight_response_5|Nonetheless, you can't stretch the fight out too long, or people will suspect a fix: one of you has to take a punch every so often. I don't care whose blood is spilled, but there has to be some blood.{***};;
dlga_fistfight_response_5:fistfight_response_5a|And one other thing, {boy/girl}, your opponent doesn't take too well to complexity: he's just going to come straight at you. It's up to you to supply the artistry.{***};;
dlga_fistfight_response_5a:fistfight_response_confirm|So, what do you think?{***};;
dlga_fistfight_response_confirm:close_window.1|I've better things to do.{***};;
dlga_start:nw_rangers_aggro_1|Hold it!{***};;
dlga_start:nw_rangers_1|Greetings, brother. How goes the watch?{***};;
dlga_start:nw_rangers_2|Greetings, traveller. What brings you to these parts?{***};;
dlga_nw_rangers_2:nw_rangers_3|I wish to join the Night's Watch.{***};;
dlga_nw_rangers_2:nw_rangers_6|I am just exploring the North.{***};;
dlga_nw_rangers_2:nw_rangers_7|Your watch has come to an end. Let the Thenns be feasting on your flesh tonight!{***};;
dlga_nw_rangers_3:nw_rangers_4|I'm sorry, ma'am, but the Watch accepts only men.{***};;
dlga_nw_rangers_3:nw_rangers_4.1|If you wish to join us, go to Castle Black and do so. We need every man we can muster.{***};;
dlga_nw_rangers_4:nw_rangers_5|Now if you would excuse us, we are on duty. Farewell.{***};;
dlga_nw_rangers_5:close_window|Farewell.{***};;
dlga_nw_rangers_6:close_window|Exploring is a risky endeavour around here, traveller. Keep an eye out for trouble.{***};;
dlga_nw_rangers_7:close_window|So be it, scum! Now you must die!  BROTHERS! TO ARMS!{***};;
dlga_nw_rangers_1:nw_rangers_8|I've been trailing some Wildling raiders.{***};;
dlga_nw_rangers_1:nw_rangers_9|Nothing much of interest, ser.{***};;
dlga_nw_rangers_8:close_window|Find and destroy them, brother, and may the Seven guide you.{***};;
dlga_nw_rangers_9:close_window|Then enjoy the day, brother.{***};;
dlga_nw_rangers_aggro_1:close_window|Come then, crows!{***};;
dlga_nw_rangers_aggro_1:nw_rangers_aggro_2|Gentlemen, let's keep this civil, eh.{***};;
dlga_nw_rangers_aggro_2:close_window|The only civility you'll be getting is my blade.{***};;
dlga_start:ff_r_01|Well, what do you know, boys! A crow about to die!{***};;
dlga_start:ff_r_01.1|Well well, what do we have here?{***};;
dlga_start:ff_r_02|Hello there, {brother/sister}! How's the huntin' going?{***};;
dlga_start:ff_r_03|Ya? What do you want?{***};;
dlga_ff_r_03:ff_r_04|I want to join your clan.{***};;
dlga_ff_r_03:close_window|Only to see your corpse before me.{***};;
dlga_ff_r_03:close_window.1|Nothing, sorry to bother you.{***};;
dlga_ff_r_04:close_window|You? To join us? Hmph.^Go find {s1}. He'll decide if you're fit or not.{***};;
dlga_ff_r_02:close_window|We shan't be going hungry tonight, if you catch my drift, heheh.{***};;
dlga_ff_r_02:ff_r_03|Agh, no such luck yet.{***};;
dlga_ff_r_03:close_window.2|Haha, good luck to you then.{***};;
dlga_ff_r_01:close_window|Show me your steel, scum!{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.4|Your life ends here, Wildling!{***};;
dlga_start:nw_r_01|Ah, good to see you, brother.{***};;
dlga_start:nw_r_04|Greetings, traveller. What can I do for you?{***};;
dlga_nw_r_01:nw_r_02|How goes the recruiting?{***};;
dlga_nw_r_01:nw_r_03|You need any help?{***};;
dlga_nw_r_02:close_window|Bah! Only scoundrels and scum bags, like usual. These are dark times for the Watch, brother.{***};;
dlga_nw_r_03:close_window|Nah, I can handle it. You should be attending to your own duties though, shouldn't you?{***};;
dlga_nw_r_04:nw_r_05|I wish to join the Night's Watch.{***};;
dlga_nw_r_04:nw_r_06|You can give up your steel or die a slow death!{***};;
dlga_nw_r_04:close_window|Nothing, sorry.{***};;
dlga_nw_r_05:nw_r_07|You seem like an able man, and the Seven know we need all the help we can get.^You should go to Castle Black and speak with {s1}.{***};;
dlga_nw_r_05:close_window|Sorry to say, but the Watch accepts only men, so you can't join us. Nothing; maybe there's a better occupation for you somewhere else.{***};
dlga_nw_r_06:close_window|So be it, though such aggression is irrational. Grab your blade and pray the Seven have mercy.{***};;
dlga_nw_r_07:close_window|Thank you. I will.{***};;
dlga_start:varys_intro_1|Well met, weary traveller, I'm Lord Varys and I serve here in King's Landing.{***};;
dlga_varys_intro_1:varys_intro_2|The Master of Whispers on the King’s Small Council?{***};;
dlga_varys_intro_1:close_window|I should be leaving.{***};;
dlga_varys_intro_2:varys_intro_3|Very perceptive of you, {ser/madam}. Yes, I'm the Master of Whispers and an advisor to the King. I serve whomever sits the Iron Throne, who at this moment in time happens to be {s1}. Now, what business do have here in King's Landing?{***};;
dlga_varys_intro_3:varys_intro_4|Sorry, I'm not one to disclose my secrets to just anyone.{***};;
dlga_varys_intro_4:varys_generic|No need, {playername}, Westeros is full of little birds that whisper me secrets, my friend. Something you should do wise to remember.{***};;
dlga_varys_generic:varys_quest_1|Is there anything I can do for you, Lord Varys?{***};;
dlga_varys_generic:close_window|Apologies, I must take my leave.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.5|Hello again, {playername}. It's good to see you; however, I'm rather busy at the moment. Maybe we can talk some other time.{***};
dlga_start:close_window.6|Hello again, {playername}. I'm happy to see you again. Unfortunately, I've got no need of you right now. Maybe some other time.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_1:varys_quest_2|Well, it’s not every day I find a {man/woman} seeking to earn my favour - very few would be of a mind. The King would offer lands and titles for the heads of his enemies. Lord Baelish would proffer coin for those who work on his behalf. Many a lord and indeed many a king would offer much the same, but me? Why, I've only the reward of my friendship. If that is no use to you, then I bid you good day.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_2:varys_quest_3|Friendship to the greatest spymaster in all the lands is nothing to squander if you offer it, Lord Varys.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_2:close_window|Well then, I suppose I'd best be on my way.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_3:varys_quest_4|Hmm, yes - we'll see. Well, if you're so eager to please me, I do happen to have a small errand to run. An agent of mine in Dorne is due to deliver to me a report on certain goings-on. Normally I would send one of my usual little helpers, but you seem ready for the journey right now. Make your way to Sunspear and introduce yourself to everyone you meet as a merchant selling happy dreams. My agent will greet you with a request for sad memories.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_4:varys_quest_5|You'll be given a roll of paper with a coded message, which you're to deliver to me in haste. I trust you're up to this task?{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_5:close_window|It shall be done, Lord Varys.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_5:varys_quest_6|I'm afraid I cannot complete the task at this time.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_6:close_window|Such a pity. Well, you're unfortunately of no use to me then. Farewell.{***};;
dlga_start:varys_quest_report|Hello again, {playername}. I trust things are well?{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_report:varys_quest_1_done|I've got your message with me.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_report:varys_quest_2_report|About catching that spy...{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_report:varys_quest_3_done|I've eliminated the knights.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_report:varys_quest_4_done|I bring you the dozen Skilled Bravos.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_report:varys_quest_5_done|I've delivered the message, and I agreed.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_report:varys_quest_not_yet_done|I'm still working on the task you gave me.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_not_yet_done:close_window|Good, good. Just don't take too long.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_1_done:close_window|Ah, my message. The seal is unbroken and my cipher is undisturbed, well done. I may have misled you earlier, for I'm no Master of Coin, but I've my ways of acquiring needed funds. Here you go, and do remember to come back later in case I might have further use for you.{***};;
dlga_start:varys_quest_2_1|Ah, {playername}! It is fortunate that you've arrived; I've got a job for someone of your calibre. In this city, at this very moment, is a spy, and not one in my service, I might add. I know who he is and what his business here is, and though it would be simplicity itself to have him seized, I fear that this act might alert his cohorts within the walls. He intends to leave tonight and head south by the Kingsroad; my sources report him earlier asking travellers about that way. Like as not, the man intends to meet someone far from prying eyes, and I want you to follow him. Capturing the spy is paramount, but his contact would be an excellent prize as well. They may have escorts: deal with them as you see fit.{***}
dlga_varys_quest_2_1:varys_quest_2_2|Are you prepared for this assignment?{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_2_2:close_window|It shall be done, my lord.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_2_2:varys_quest_2_3|I'm afraid I cannot complete the task at this time.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_2_3:close_window|This is rather unfortunate then. In this case, I won't be needing your services any more.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_2_report:varys_quest_2_succeeded|Ah, you've arrived - and with our late visitor to this fine city in tow. And it appears his friend is also in your custody. Well, I must say you've certainly earned your reward for a job well done. Worry not, I shall not harm either of them. They'll be detained for as long as it takes to resolve certain matters, which may be greatly sped up by their cooperation, of course. You know, I'm starting to see the allure of retaining the services of such warriors as yourself. I deal with kings and noble lords on a regular basis, but even the guards of this city will only heed my requests for fear of angering those whom I serve. Thank you once more for your services, and here is your payment. Take this as well. I've just finished reading it myself. “A History of the Great Sieges of Westeros”, by Archmaester Ch’Vyalthan; the man was not the best writer, but he had some good advice on how best to assail a fortified position. Hardly a use to me, but you may find it insightful.{***};
dlga_varys_quest_2_report:varys_quest_2_half_done|Ah, you've arrived - and with our late visitor to this fine city in tow I see. And what of his contact? I understand... well, unfortunate but no great loss. Worry not, I shall not harm the man. He'll be detained for as long as it takes to resolve certain matters, which may be greatly sped up by his cooperation, of course. You know, I'm starting to see the allure of retaining the services of such warriors as yourself. I deal with kings and noble lords on a regular basis, but even the guards of this city will only heed my requests for fear of angering those whom I serve. Thank you once more for your services, and here is your payment.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_2_report:varys_quest_2_half_done.1|Ah, you've arrived. Though it would seem that you've lost the target. Oh, you've got his contact in your custody? Very good, he should prove most useful. Worry not, I shall not harm the man. He'll be detained for as long as it takes to resolve certain matters, which may be greatly sped up by his cooperation, of course. You know, I'm starting to see the allure of retaining the services of such warriors as yourself. I deal with kings and noble lords on a regular basis, but even the guards of this city will only heed my requests for fear of angering those whom I serve. Thank you once more for your services, and here is your payment.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_2_report:varys_quest_2_failed|Ah, you've arrived... too bad that you've managed to lose both of the targets. This means that everything was in vain and that I shan't be able to extract any information from them. But worry not, I'll do you no harm, but I'm unable to reward you, given that you've not completed your job. I also think that I'll no longer have use of your services. Farewell.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_2_succeeded:close_window|Thank you, my lord.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_2_half_done:close_window|I did my best, my lord.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_2_failed:close_window|Hmph. As you like, my lord.{***};;
dlga_start:varys_quest_3_1|Hello again, my friend, it is good to see you once more. An urgent matter has arisen - one I think you are best suited to resolve. I'll be brief: a rather large group of hedge knights has set up camp on the road leading to Duskendale. They claim to be about the King’s business, which is, strictly speaking, untrue. I need you to assemble your own force and march out to meet them. Kill or capture every last one of them; they must ultimately be dispersed. I know I'm asking a great deal of you, but I assure you that this is for the good of the realm. I trust in your discretion and efficiency as before. Well, are you up to the task?{***};
dlga_varys_quest_3_1:close_window|I'll do it, Lord Varys.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_3_1:varys_quest_2_3|I'm afraid I cannot complete the task at this time.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_3_done:varys_quest_3_2|It does me no end of good to see you safe and sound. My little birds report a disturbance on the road to Duskendale. A nasty business, but you're to be commended for your performance on the field. I suppose there's little point in hiding the truth of the matter from you now that the deed is done.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_3_2:varys_quest_3_3|Those hedge knights you encountered, and so roundly defeated, were pawns in the employ of the Master of Coins, our own Lord Baelish. They, of course, would not have known that: he used channels available only to a member of the Small Council to encourage the notion that they were on some grand venture on behalf of the King. Without any doubt he'll have little trouble replacing them; the lands are rife with such desperate men. But your actions have stymied his plans and set his schemes back for the moment.{***};
dlga_varys_quest_3_3:varys_quest_3_4|Do not act so surprised, the Master of Coins he may be, but Petyr Baelish is no man to underestimate. His ambitions are a threat to the stability of the realm, and I strongly suspect he had a hand in bringing about the chaos that has engulfed Westeros. However, this is no concern to leave on your head. You've done your part, my {friend/lady}. Here's your payment, as expected, and a special gift. The one gathering dust in the royal armoury is merely a cheap replica, but only its original owner would ever be able to tell the difference. Fortunately, that's no concern that need ever cross your mind.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_3_4:close_window|Thank you, my lord.{***};;
dlga_start:varys_quest_4_1|Well, my {friend/lady}, it seems that in spite of myself I've grown to rely upon you. It's so hard to find good help these days, and in time it will grow harder still. I've another task for you, one thankfully less exciting than the one I handed you earlier. Are you familiar with Skilled Bravos? Expert swordsmen, unequalled in the use of light blades and revered for their martial prowess among the Free Cities. Their talents are mostly disregarded in Westeros, where the value of a warrior is his ability to slaughter his opponents rather than eloquently dispatch them.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_4_1:varys_quest_4_2|Still, for certain reasons I'm in need of a dozen or so Skilled Bravos – and I need you to acquire them. Train them or hire them, but I need them assembled and brought to me to direct as I see fit. As much as it pains me to do so, I cannot reveal to you what I intend to do with them. For now know that you'll be very well rewarded for your trials and shall have my personal confidence upon completion of this venture.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_4_2:close_window|That will take time, Lord Varys, but I'll see to it.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_4_2:varys_quest_2_3|I fear this task is beyond me for the moment.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_4_done:close_window|Marvellous, these men are just as I've requested. An old friend of mine in the Free Cities is in need of their services, a very wealthy man with great influence in Essos. You see, swordsmen of such extraordinary skills as those of your new compatriots are a valued commodity among certain circles in the Free Cities - more so if their talents are proven on the field of battle. Your comrades will want for nothing in their new life working for my old friend, and in turn he shall accrue great prestige from having them in his retinue. I'll say no more, other than that you've proven a most valuable agent to me. Your reward, my {friend/lady}, as promised. Use it in good health.{***};;
dlga_start:varys_quest_5_1|Ah, it's you. I trust you've been well since our last meeting? These are dangerous times, and I like to make sure that my friends are in good health. Today at least has been a good one, the wind has sent away the foul odours that normally arise from the city's lower quarters, and the sun was kind enough to hide behind the odd cloud. It feels perfect for a stroll – why don’t you meet me behind the Sept of Baelor and we can discuss some items of note?{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_5_1:close_window|An odd request, but certainly.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_5_1:varys_quest_2_3|I don’t have time to wander about the city, Varys.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.7|Meet me behind the Great Sept of Baelor, {playername}. Then, we shall speak.{***};;
dlga_start:varys_quest_5_2|Ah, the Sept of Baelor - beautiful, isn’t it? Fully recovered from the sack of King's Landing during King Robert’s rebellion. It was the only building project Lord Tywin deigned to contribute to free of charge after his army returned home with their plunder.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_5_2:varys_quest_5_3|We're standing not far from where Lord Eddard Stark, former Hand of the King, lost his head. He was a good man and didn't deserve this fate or the misery that befell his family. But in my experience people rarely get what they deserve: often those are punished who should be praised, and those who are praised should instead be punished. After the Sack of King's Landing, Eddard Stark was the only lord to demand any justice for the murders of Elia of Dorne and her children. He nearly lost his head then too. What do you think? Would you've agreed with Eddard Stark - did the Targaryen children and their mother not deserve justice?{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_5_3:varys_quest_5_5|No one deserved that, least of all a mother and her children.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_5_3:varys_quest_5_4|Her children were incest born dragon spawns. It needed to be done.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_5_4:close_window|I see. A common view held by those who would align themselves with the high courts of this land. What use to fight for the dead, after all? Here, the remainder of your payment. You’ve done nothing wrong, but I cannot retain the services of more public agents for long lest they be targeted by my adversaries. Seek out others in the Court who could use your skill, or take to the field and claim your own glory. May it as it be, but our work together is at an end. Now, I believe there is a new shipment of saffron just in from across the Narrow Sea. Always a delight to meet new people, wouldn’t you agree? I bid you a good day.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_5_5:close_window|A most rare insight. Very few would utter such words for fear of angering those who have risen on the downfall of the Targaryen family. Your compassion does you credit, as does your dedication to the realm. You've proven yourself a valuable ally to me, which is why I've one more task for you. I need you to return to Dorne once more, this time with a message in hand. Seek an audience with Ellaria Sand, and all will be explained. I've got much to prepare for, and I hope you make the right decision. Fare you well.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_5_done:close_window|You're truly a noble {man/woman}, {playername}. I'm delighted that you've made the right decision. You'll always be a friend to me, and I thank you for your services to the realm.{***};;
dlga_varys_quest_5_5:close_window.1|A most rare insight. Very few would utter such words for fear of angering those who have risen on the downfall of the Targaryen family. Your compassion does you credit, as does your dedication to the realm. You've proven yourself a valuable ally to me, which is why I've one more task for you.

I've got much to prepare for, and I hope you make the right decision. Fare you well.{***};;
dlga_start:varys_generic|Hello again, my {good Ser/sweet Lady}. What brings you to me?{***};;
dlga_start:doran_1|So, you're Varys agent? I'd never expected him to contract someone openly, especially a warrior such as yourself. He's many who serve him, but few walk openly in the light as you do. I'm Prince Doran Martell, ruler of Dorne. Prince Oberyn Martell leads our armies and acts in my capacity due to my... ailments. The message you've brought me is brief but speaks of your reliability. I hope that's the case.{***};;
dlga_doran_1:doran_2|Why do you serve the Spider? For baubles perhaps, or does his talk of serving the realm appeal to your sense of duty?{***};;
dlga_doran_2:doran_3|He speaks of serving the realm, not just whomever sits the throne or himself.{***};;
dlga_doran_2:doran_3.1|He's been a good patron to me so far.{***};;
dlga_doran_3:doran_4|Westeros is torn by war, those who should protect it instead destroy it. I fear dark days are ahead for Dorne if the land should trade wardens for warlords intent on their own enrichment. The North and the Riverlands both strive for their independence, the Lannisters seek to regain control no matter the cost, Stannis fights for dominance whilst the Reach blunders under the direction of Mace Tyrell, and the Vale and the Iron Islands do as they please. These conflicts are a festering wound that needs be cauterized by fire. Only one House has ever managed to unite these desperate lands, and they did so 300 years ago.{***};;
dlga_doran_4:doran_5|The Targaryens - but they're all dead, aren't they?{***};;
dlga_doran_5:doran_6|Not all, no. Two remain in the world to my knowledge. Alas, the third one fell victim to a crown of molten gold. Only one is within reach of contact, and only through a source you and I both know.{***};;
dlga_doran_6:doran_7|Varys? What does he have to do with all this?{***};;
dlga_doran_7:doran_8|Everything. When King’s Landing fell, so Varys tells me, he secured the safety of my sister's youngest child at the terrible cost of another's life. He took this child, this young dragon, across the sea to live secluded in safety from the hunters who would be sent by Tywin Lannister or Robert Baratheon if they knew. I hesitate to believe this, though it would mean much to know something of my sister yet survives in this world. But I am told this child is now grown and gathers allies to him with the aid of powerful friends. Perhaps you've heard that the Golden Company has broken its contract with Myr? They're no doubt complicit.{***};;
dlga_doran_8:doran_9|It hurts me even to stand, such is the advanced stage of my sickness. But for this I'll stand. Varys says you're sympathetic to the plight of the realm, and even the injustice visited upon my sister's family. Elia was dear to me, and I'll see her avenged. If the young dragon comes across the Narrow Sea with his army, I'll make sure Dorne is ready to bear arms for him. But he'll need more than allies: he's in desperate need of loyal vassals if he is to reclaim his birthright. Whether for riches or for the good of the realm, you need to muster your strength and prepare to join with him. Aid him against his enemies and you'll have my eternal gratitude. I guarantee that you may be received properly when he reaches Westeros of your intent. Are you prepared for the days ahead?{***};;
dlga_doran_9:doran_11|I'm ready to aid the Targaryens in their fight for the Iron Throne!{***};;
dlga_doran_9:doran_10|I need time to think about this.{***};;
dlga_doran_10:close_window|Very well, but make it quick. We've no time to lose.{***};;
dlga_doran_11:close_window|Good, good. I must retire soon as this session has drained me. Know that you've made the right decision. Prepare yourself, gather friends and sharpen blades. When the young king arrives, cast off all prior allegiance and join with him. Take this for your trouble, and know that Dorne will fight alongside you.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.8|You're free to take your leave now, {playername}. Go and prepare, for when the dragon comes, he will show no mercy to his enemies.{***};;
dlga_start:doran_9|Well? Have you made up your mind?{***};;
dlga_start:ellaria_1|So, you're Varys agent? I'd never expected him to contract someone openly, especially a warrior such as yourself. He's many who serve him, but few walk openly in the light as you do. I'm Ellaria Sand. The message you've brought me is brief but speaks of your reliability. I hope that's the case.{***};;
dlga_ellaria_1:ellaria_2|Why do you serve the Spider? For baubles perhaps, or does his talk of serving the realm appeal to your sense of duty?{***};;
dlga_ellaria_2:ellaria_3|He speaks of serving the realm, not just whomever sits the throne or himself.{***};;
dlga_ellaria_2:ellaria_3.1|He's been a good patron to me so far.{***};;
dlga_ellaria_3:ellaria_4|Westeros is torn by war, those who should protect it instead destroy it. I fear dark days are ahead for Dorne if the land should trade wardens for warlords intent on their own enrichment. The North and the Riverlands both strive for their independence, the Lannisters seek to regain control no matter the cost, Stannis fights for dominance whilst the Reach blunders under the direction of Mace Tyrell, and the Vale and the Iron Islands do as they please. These conflicts are a festering wound that needs be cauterized by fire. Only one House has ever managed to unite these desperate lands, and they did so 300 years ago.{***};;
dlga_ellaria_4:ellaria_5|The Targaryens - but they're all dead, aren't they?{***};;
dlga_ellaria_5:ellaria_6|Not all, no. One remains in the world to my knowledge. Alas, the other one fell victim to a crown of molten gold. She is within reach of contact, and only through a source you and I both know.{***};;
dlga_ellaria_6:ellaria_7|Varys?{***};;
dlga_ellaria_7:ellaria_8|Varys has been in contact with Daenerys Targaryen. I am told she has gathered an army of Dothraki and Unsullied and plans to sail onto Westeros. We are told she will be first stopping at Dragonstone.{***};;
dlga_ellaria_8:ellaria_9|Varys says you're sympathetic to the plight of the realm. If the Dragon Queen comes across the Narrow Sea with her army, Dorne will be ready to bear arms for her. But she will need more than allies: she is in desperate need of loyal vassals if she is to reclaim her birthright. Whether for riches or for the good of the realm, you need to muster your strength and prepare to join with her. I guarantee that you may be received properly when she reaches Westeros of your intent. Are you prepared for the days ahead?{***};;
dlga_ellaria_9:ellaria_11|I'm ready to aid the Targaryens in their fight for the Iron Throne!{***};;
dlga_ellaria_9:ellaria_10|I need time to think about this.{***};;
dlga_ellaria_10:close_window|Very well, but make it quick. We've no time to lose.{***};;
dlga_ellaria_11:close_window|Good, good. Know that you've made the right decision. Prepare yourself, gather friends and sharpen blades. When the Dragon Queen arrives, cast off all prior allegiance and join with us. Take this for your trouble, and know that Dorne will fight alongside you.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.9|You're free to take your leave now, {playername}. Go and prepare, for when the Dragon Queen comes, she shall show no mercy to her enemies.{***};;

dlga_hallyne_do2:hallyne_do3|The Substance?{***};;
dlga_hallyne_do3:hallyne_do4|Yes yes, the Substance. Others may call it Wildfire, but we Pyromancers call it the Substance.{***};;
dlga_hallyne_do4:hallyne_do5|How could I obtain this Wildfire?{***};;
dlga_hallyne_do5:hallyne3|Well, my {friend/lady}, due to its... erm... let's say volatile nature, only the King himself can instruct me to create such magic for him.{***};;

dlga_start:frey_trainer_talk|Good greetings, {ser/madam}. I'm the Master at Arms here at the Twins. I train the troops required by the current lord.{***};;
dlga_frey_trainer_talk:frey_trainer_talk1|What sort of troops can you train here?{***};;
dlga_frey_trainer_talk1:frey_trainer_talk2|I train troops specific to House Frey.{***};;

dlga_start:lannister_trainer_lord|Good greetings, {your Lordship/my Lady}. Do you require me to train you some Lannister levies? It will cost you 5,000 stags for training and equipping 40 men. I can have them ready for you in a couple of weeks.{***};;

dlga_innkeeper_1_talk:close_window|Nice to meet you, Sharna.{***};;
dlga_innkeeper_1_talk:close_window.1|Right.{***};;
dlga_start:innkeeper_talk_2|What ho, {lad/lassie}. I'm the innkeeper here at the Old Stone Bridge.{***};;
dlga_innkeeper_talk_2:close_window|No shit?{***};;
dlga_innkeeper_talk_2:close_window.1|No shit.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.18|What of ya? Just mindin' me own business an' havin' a drink, {lad/lassie}.{***};;
dlga_start:innkeeper_1_talk.1|How fare you? I'm the owner of this establishment. Hey, aren't you the one who saved us from those Wildlings?{***};;
dlga_innkeeper_1_talk:innkeeper_2_talk|Oh me? It was nothing.{***};;
dlga_innkeeper_1_talk:close_window.2|Actually yeah. But who's going to save you from me, eh?!{***};;
dlga_innkeeper_2_talk:close_window|We all appreciate your help. Feel free to rest here whenever you need, {lad/lass}.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.19|Can't you see I'm busy.{***};;
dlga_start:tavern_npc2_talk|How fares it, {ser/madam}? What can I do for you?{***};;
dlga_tavern_npc2_talk:tavern_npc2_talk_2|Well met, I'm looking for information on who owns this establishment.{***};;
dlga_tavern_npc2_talk_2:tavern_npc2_talk_3|That would be me, {ser/madam}. My name's Masha Heddle. My grandfather used to own this place before me. {***};;
dlga_tavern_npc2_talk_3:tavern_npc2_talk_4|Oh, I see. How long has this place been here?{***};;
dlga_tavern_npc2_talk_3:close_window|Alright, thank you. That's all I needed to know.{***};;
dlga_tavern_npc2_talk_4:tavern_npc2_talk_5|This inn has stood here a very long time, since Jaehaerys I, in fact. It's had many names: The Two Crowns, The Bellringer Inn, and the Clanking Dragon. People from all over Westeros visit here. If you need to find someone, then this is where they would probably be.{***};;
dlga_tavern_npc2_talk_5:close_window|Sounds good, thank you.{***};;
dlga_start:local_traveller_talk|Well met, {ser/madam}.{***};;
dlga_local_traveller_talk:local_traveller_talk_2|Well met, who are you?{***};;
dlga_local_traveller_talk_2:local_traveller_talk_3|Me? Why? I'm just a mere traveller. Westeros, Essos, I've travelled all over the known world. If I were to know you better, I'd have some secrets I could tell you. Ha, but never mind about that, {ser/madam}.{***};;
dlga_local_traveller_talk_2:close_window|Me? Why? I'm just a mere traveller, {ser/madam}. Westeros, Essos, I've travelled all over the known world. If I were to know you better, I'd have some secrets I could tell. Ha, but never mind about that.{***};;
dlga_local_traveller_talk_3:local_traveller_talk_4|I could guarantee good things if you were tell me your 'secrets'...{***};;
dlga_local_traveller_talk_4:local_traveller_talk_5|Ha, well, you're a persuasive character, aren't you?! Very well. Whilst travelling to Qohor, I met a weaponsmith who could reforge Valyrian blades. I can't quite remember his name though.{***};;
dlga_local_traveller_talk_5:local_traveller_talk_6|Anything else?{***};;
dlga_local_traveller_talk_5:close_window|Sounds good, I'll have to go visit this weaponsmith sometime, eh. Thanks.{***};;
dlga_local_traveller_talk_6:close_window|Ha ,you're not that persuasive, {ser/madam}.{***};;
dlga_start:tavern_npc3_talk|Hic... hell..lo, {ser/madam}.{***};;
dlga_tavern_npc3_talk:tavern_npc3_talk_2|Umm, hello...{***};;
dlga_tavern_npc3_talk_2:close_window|My w...w...ifes gon... kill me. Burps!{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.20|Leave me be. I'm not here to talk!{***};;
dlga_start:gambler_talk|Hail fellow well met, my {friend/lady}. Maybe you fancy trying your luck?{***};;
dlga_gambler_talk:tavern_tk_3cards|Sure, why not.{***};;
dlga_gambler_talk:close_window|No, thanks.{***};;
dlga_tavern_tk_3cards:close_window|Alright, the rules are simple. Find the Lady and you win, if not, you lose.{***};;
dlga_tavern_tk_3cards:close_window.1|I guess you can't: you don't have enough coins, {lad/lassie}.{***};;
dlga_start:ruined_quest_menu|Good day {ser/lady}. You look like someone well travelled. Do you want to hear a story?{***};;
dlga_ruined_quest_menu:ruined_quest_yes|I have plenty of time. Sure, why not.{***};;
dlga_ruined_quest_menu:ruined_quest_no|No thanks, I'm busy.{***};;
dlga_ruined_quest_yes:ruined_quest_story|Ah good! Well, I'm Ser Janis Lyren. My family go way back when, to Valyria, ya know. Well Lord Petyr Lyren, my father god rest his soul, used to tell me all sorts of my ancestry.{***};;
dlga_ruined_quest_no:close_window|As you wish {my lord/my lady}.{***};;
dlga_ruined_quest_story:ruined_quest_story1|It so happens we used to have a home, a castle in fact somewhere near Essos. No idea where it is now mind. But I wouldn't mind finding it! My poor father passed away some time ago now and all his memories with him.{***};;
dlga_ruined_quest_story1:ruined_quest_story_choice|I've been waiting here in the hope someone will help me find it. I want nothing for it mind, just to allow me to live out the rest of my days there. The castle can be yours, just look after it with pride is all I say. Agree and I will help you search for it.{***};;
dlga_ruined_quest_story_choice:ruined_quest_choice_yes|Sounds interesting. What do you have in mind? Any idea where to start looking?{***};;
dlga_ruined_quest_story_choice:ruined_quest_choice_no|This all seems very fascinating, but I'm way too busy for such an expedition. Maybe some other time.{***};;
dlga_ruined_quest_choice_yes:ruined_quest_choice_yes1_new|Well, here's the thing, all I know is it's near Essos. Oh, and it's in ruins, did I forget to mention that part? Anyhow we will need tools, at least 50 men and possibly around 10k stags. It's a lot to ask I know. But if we do find it, then you have a castle for yourself and I can rest knowing I have fulfilled my fathers dream.{***};;
dlga_ruined_quest_choice_yes1_new:ruined_quest_choice_yes1|We should probably acquire a ship too, no telling where this place could be. Oh and don't forget to stock up on supplies and bring some good men. It could be a long and dangerous expedition.{***};;
dlga_ruined_quest_choice_no:close_window|Ah, fair enough. I'll possibly still be here should you change your mind.{***};;
dlga_ruined_quest_choice_yes1:ruined_quest_choice_yes2|As soon as you're ready we can leave. Though don't be waiting too long, someone else may well pass who's in the need of a castle to call home.{***};;
dlga_ruined_quest_choice_yes2:close_window|Ok let's go.{***};;
dlga_ruined_quest_choice_yes2:close_window.1|This all seems too much. I think I'm going to pass, but thanks.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.21|Good day {ser/my lady}.{***};;
dlga_start:measter_menu|Well, it does my art good to see you, good {ser/madam}.{***};;
dlga_measter_menu:pycelle1|Well met. What's your story, old man?{***};;
dlga_pycelle1:pycelle2|I'm the Grand Maester of the Citadel here in King's Landing. I've mastered the study of the higher mysteries. You know, not a lot of maesters can boast about that.{***};;
dlga_pycelle2:close_window|I must leave.{***};;
dlga_pycelle2:pycelle3|A man of your .. stature must have served many Kings?{***};;
dlga_pycelle3:pycelle4|A man of your .. stature must have served many Kings?{***};;
dlga_pycelle4:pycelle5|Oh, I can tell you all there is to know about Kings. The thing you need to understand about Kings is... For the past 67 years, I've known... truly known more Kings than any man alive. They're complicated men, but I know how to serve them. Yes. And keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen... of all the thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. He was a good man, such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood.{***};;
dlga_pycelle5:pycelle6|Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal... powerful man, a great warrior... but alas, winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now I serve a new King, may the Gods bless his reign. But I sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King. True greatness.{***};;
dlga_pycelle6:pycelle7|So what's the thing?{***};;
dlga_pycelle7:pycelle8|What thing?{***};;
dlga_pycelle8:pycelle9|About Kings. You said, the thing you need to understand about Kings...{***};;
dlga_pycelle9:pycelle10|What? Things? What?{***};;
dlga_pycelle10:close_window|When you started, you... never mind.{***};;
dlga_start:measter_menu.1|How can I be of help to you, {ser/madam}?{***};;
dlga_measter_menu:npc32_2|Is that a Valyrian steel link you're wearing?{***};;
dlga_measter_menu:close_window|I must leave now.{***};;
dlga_npc32_2:npc32_3|Ah, yes, maesters are awarded the link for their involvement in the learning of magic.{***};;
dlga_npc32_3:npc32_4|Do you believe magic still exists?{***};;
dlga_npc32_4:close_window|Oh, of course not. Magic was once a mighty force in the world, but not any longer. What little remains is no more than the wisp of smoke that lingers in the air after a great fire has burned out, and even that is fading away. Valyria was the last ember, and it's gone forever.{***};;
dlga_start:hodor_talk|Hodor!{***};;
dlga_hodor_talk:hodor_talk_2|Are you ok??{***};;
dlga_hodor_talk_2:hodor_talk_3|Hodor!{***};;
dlga_hodor_talk_3:close_window|Mhm...{***};;
dlga_start:hodor_talk.1|Do you want to fly? Yes, lets make you fly...{***};;
dlga_hodor_talk:hodor_talk_2.1|No thanks.{***};;
dlga_hodor_talk_2:hodor_talk_3.1|Well, I'm Lord of the Vale and I can make anyone fly. Wooosh right through the moon door.{***};;
dlga_hodor_talk_3:close_window.1|I gotta go.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.22|Do you enjoy staring at a dwarf!?{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.23|Do you support the Lord of Light, dear {boy/girl}?{***};;
dlga_start:miss1|You stand in the presence on Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryan, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, the rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains.{***};;
dlga_miss1:close_window|I am {playername}.{***};;
dlga_miss1:miss2|Tell me a joke.{***};;
dlga_miss2:miss3|Two translators are on a sinking ship. The first says, Do you know how to swim? The second says, No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages.{***};;
dlga_miss3:close_window|That is the worst joke I ever heard.{***};;
dlga_start:aemon_menu|My {lord/lady}, how art thou? To whom do I have the pleasure of speaking with?{***};;
dlga_aemon_menu:npc36_2|What cheer, maester? My name's {playername}.{***};;
dlga_aemon_menu:npc36_4|Mind your own business, old man!{***};;
dlga_aemon_menu:close_window|Sorry, I've to leave.{***};;
dlga_npc36_2:measter_menu|And what is it I can do you for, {playername}?{***};;
dlga_npc36_4:close_window|...{***};;
dlga_measter_menu:npc36_ww|What have you heard about these White Walkers?{***};;
dlga_measter_menu:npc36_nw|Can you tell me how to join the Night's Watch?{***};;
dlga_measter_menu:close_window.1|Sorry, I've to leave.{***};;
dlga_npc36_ww:measter_menu|Hmm... you know, the Starks are always right eventually: 'winter is coming'. This one will be long, and dark things will come with it.{***};;
dlga_npc36_nw:npc36_nw2|You cannot simply join the Night's Watch, dear friend. You should speak to {s1} if your request is sincere.{***};;
dlga_npc36_nw2:measter_menu|Alright, thank you.{***};;
dlga_npc36_nw:npc36_nw3|I'm afraid it's too late, friend. The Night's Watch have already been defeated: the shield has been shattered. We must now pray to all the gods in the hope someone will save the realms of men.{***};;
dlga_npc36_nw3:close_window|...{***};;
dlga_start:measter_menu.2|Pleasures meeting you. I'm the maester here at Dragonstone. Anything I can do for you?{***};;
dlga_measter_menu:pylos_2|What can you tell me about this dreary place?{***};;
dlga_measter_menu:close_window.2|No, thank you.{***};;
dlga_pylos_2:pylos_3|Ah, Dragonstone. It's built on an active volcano called Dragonmont. Unfortunately yes, this means this rock is wet, cold, and very dreary.{***};;
dlga_pylos_3:pylos_4|Please, carry on.{***};;
dlga_pylos_3:close_window|OK, I've heard enough.{***};;
dlga_pylos_4:pylos_5|Oh, of course. Dragonstone was built by the Targaryens almost five centuries ago. They did employ an entire army of masons and labourers to raise these stones atop the cliffs. Some of the more simple minded think they resorted to magic, but, beside the fact that every fool could build a castle having that labour force at hand, that's mostly because the used building techniques have been lost to the ages: those simpletons call everything magic they don't understand.{***};;
dlga_pylos_5:close_window|But I get off the point. Dragonstone is the largest of the Valyrian strongholds to survive the cataclysm we call the Doom. Ah, there are so many things I could tell you. Do you know there are still many obsidian deposits in the tunnels below the mountain?!{***};;
dlga_start:petyr1|Have a good day, and who are you?{***};;
dlga_petyr1:petyr2|Littlefinger to most, an amusing nickname, don't you think?{***};;
dlga_petyr2:petyr3|Possibly.{***};;
dlga_petyr2:petyr4|Pahaha! Littlefinger?! I'll bet that's not the only thing little about you!{***};;
dlga_petyr3:close_window|It was given to me by a Tully boy, rather creative back in his day. He chose it for me because of my size, that and the fact I grew up on the smallest peninsula of the Vale. The name was cruel enough to stick, but I've grown rather fond of it.{***};;
dlga_petyr4:close_window|Mock me all you want, dear {boy/girl}. But just remember this: I always get what I want, so please be careful.{***};;
dlga_event_triggered:wildling_farm|You think you can make a difference?! You can't! Winter's coming... and those things with it... stay this side of the wall unless you want to be taken by the cold!{***};;
dlga_wildling_farm:wildling_farm2|You watch as the wildling takes his last few breaths...{***};;
dlga_wildling_farm2:close_window|You must take this news to King Robb right away. He may have use of it.{***};;
dlga_start:measter_menu.3|I've not seen you before.{***};;
dlga_measter_menu:close_window.3|Very good, I need to go. Farewell.{***};;
dlga_start:measter_menu.4|I'm the maester here at Eastwatch.{***};;
dlga_start:measter_menu.5|Greetings, I'm the maester here at Shadow Tower.{***};;
dlga_measter_menu:close_window.4|Very good, I need to go. Fare thee well.{***};;
dlga_start:measter_menu.6|Hail and well met, my {lord/lady}. I'm Maester Wendamyr.{***};;
dlga_measter_menu:close_window.5|Very good, I need to go. Goodbye.{***};;

dlga_start:measter_menu.11|Good greetings, my {lord/lady}. I'm Maester Tybald.{***};;
dlga_start:measter_menu.12|Good greetings, my {lord/lady}.{***};;
dlga_start:nan_1|Maybe you would like to hear a story?{***};;
dlga_nan_1:nan_2|Sure.{***};;
dlga_nan_1:close_window|No thanks.{***};;
dlga_nan_2:close_window|Beyond the Wall the monsters live, the giants and the ghouls, the stalking shadows and the dead that walk, but they cannot pass so long as the Wall stands strong and the men of the Night's Watch are true.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.24|{playername}. Can you not see I'm busy.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.25|Greetings, {ser/madam}. It seems it has not yet been a week. I'm too busy right now, please come back later.{***};;
dlga_start:citadel_back_training|Ah {playername}. You are back to finish learning.{***};;
dlga_citadel_back_training:citadel_back_training1|(You show the maester what you have learnt and after several hours you feel more and more comfortable reading){***};;
dlga_citadel_back_training1:close_window|Well done {playername}. I thought we would never get there! Now go read something and get out of my way.{***};;
dlga_start:citadel_trainer_talk|Greetings, {ser/madam}. If you have something to say, please make it quick. I'm half way through the Annals of the Black Centaur and I would rather like to get it finished.{***};;
dlga_citadel_trainer_talk:citadel_trainer_talk1|I would like to learn how to read. Maybe you would be able to teach me?{***};;
dlga_citadel_trainer_talk1:citadel_trainer_talk2|Hmm, (he looks you up and down) I'm not sure you have the correct, how to say, demeanour?{***};;
dlga_citadel_trainer_talk2:citadel_trainer_talk3|OK, I tell you what, pay me 2500 stags and I will see what I can do with you. Though I can see this will be no easy feat.{***};;
dlga_citadel_trainer_talk3:close_window|Actually, I would rather not.{***};;
dlga_citadel_trainer_talk3:close_window.1|It looks like I cannot afford that.{***};;
dlga_citadel_trainer_talk3:citadel_trainer_yes|Sure, here take it.{***};;
dlga_citadel_trainer_yes:citadel_trainer_yes1|Ok good! (he starts teaching you how to read).{***};;
dlga_citadel_trainer_yes1:close_window|Now, remember what you have learnt, keep practising and come back and see me in a week. I think then you will be ready for your next lesson.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.26|I'm the Lord Commander of the city watch.{***};;
dlga_start:measter_menu.13|Hello, I am the maester here at {s9}. How can I help you?{***};;
dlga_measter_menu:healing_option|Could you take a look at my injuries, maester?{***};;
dlga_measter_menu:close_window.6|I shall leave you to your work, maester.{***};;
dlga_healing_option:healing_major|Hmm, your injuries are worse than I thought, my {lord/lady}. Would you like me to heal them? It will cost {reg1} stags.{***};;
dlga_healing_option:healing_major_lord|My {lord/lady}. Your injuries are worse than I thought. Would you like me to heal you? It will cost {reg1} stags.{***};;
dlga_healing_option:healing_minor|It seems you've a minor injury, my {lord/lady}. Would you like me to heal it? That will cost {reg1} stags.{***};;
dlga_healing_option:healing_minor_lord|My {lord/lady}. It seems you've a minor injury, would you like me to heal you? For you it will cost {reg1} stags.{***};;
dlga_healing_option:measter_menu|It looks as though you have no injuries, my {lord/lady}.{***};;
dlga_healing_minor:healing_minor_yes|Sure, go ahead.{***};;
dlga_healing_minor:measter_menu|Actually I've changed my mind.{***};;
dlga_healing_minor:measter_menu.1|Bugger, it seems I can't afford your services.{***};;
dlga_healing_minor_yes:healing_minor_finished|Here we go, just let me clamp that artery... careful... ups, sorry, that little bugger slipped away. Hand me over that pair of forceps, quickly... almost got it... ah, yes, as good as new.{***};;
dlga_healing_minor_finished:measter_menu|Thank you, maester, I feel better already.{***};;
dlga_healing_minor_lord:healing_minor_yes_lord|Sure, go ahead.{***};;
dlga_healing_minor_lord:measter_menu|Actually I've changed my mind.{***};;
dlga_healing_minor_lord:measter_menu.1|Damn, it seems I can't afford your services.{***};;
dlga_healing_minor_yes_lord:healing_minor_finished|Well then, just let me wash and bandage those wounds, actually no real challenge for a maester like myself. Ah, there you go.{***};;
dlga_healing_major:healing_major_yes|Sure, go ahead.{***};;
dlga_healing_major:measter_menu|Actually I've changed my mind.{***};;
dlga_healing_major:measter_menu.1|Damn it, it seems I can't afford your services.{***};;
dlga_healing_major_yes:healing_major_finished|Well, are you sure you don't want some milk of the poppy? This cut looks really nasty. Ah, here you can clearly see where the bone was fractured. This will hurt now, my {lord/lady}. Don't move! I've to clamp that artery before I cut here... yes, you're taking it like a true warrior, just a bit longer... fuck, that wasn't supposed to happen... wait, wait, wait, no need to panic. Quick, give me those red-hot pliers! Don't slip on that pool of blood... now close your eyes and think about something beautiful... ah, learning never stops.

dlga_healing_major_lord:measter_menu.1|Damn, it seems I can't afford your services.{***};;
dlga_healing_major_yes_lord:healing_major_finished|Alright, my {lord/lady}. Are you really sure you don't want some milk of the poppy? It's your decision. Let me take a look at that wound now. Ah, you should've visited me earlier: it's already festering. But no reason to be alarmed. I simply have to cut away the foul flesh. Now take a deep breath, my {lord/lady}... ah, that cut was a bit too deep! I should have known better than cutting so close to an artery. Quick, boy, fetch me those pliers and that little phial over there. Come on, this is serious! My {lord/lady}, can you hear me? Stay with me! Boy, I told you to be quick... ah, by the Seven, you're awake. That was pretty close, my {lord/lady}. Next time you shouldn't really wait that long before you consult a maester.{***};;
dlga_measter_menu:close_window.7|I have to go now.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.27|Mind yourself within the manse.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.28|You like big tits, my {lord/lady}? I would suggest Ros is your girl.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.29|Welcome to this fine house. All sorts of pleasures await you here, my {lord/lady}. Do you want one girl, two, or even three? Do you like them small or big, hairy or shaved? Or perhaps you prefer a boy? No wish remains unfulfilled here. One of our girls can even perform a Meereenese Knot. If you've never tasted these exotic pleasures, you haven't lived at all. Come and enjoy life within the walls of this brothel, my {lord/lady}.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.30|Welcome to the Peach, my {lord/lady}. You've come seeking the finest whores in Westeros? You should be glad you've come to the right place.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.31|Welcome to the Happy Port, my {lord/lady}. Please take your pick of our fine girls here. You won't be disappointed.{***};;
dlga_start:ramun_introduce_1|Good day to you, {young man/lassie}.{***};;
dlga_ramun_introduce_1:ramun_introduce_2|What's a man wearing the black doing so far south of the Wall?{***};;
dlga_ramun_introduce_1:close_window|Never mind.{***};;
dlga_ramun_introduce_2:ramun_introduce_3|I'm Yoren, a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. I wander the Seven Kingdoms in hope of finding men to fill our ranks.{***};;
dlga_ramun_introduce_3:ramun_introduce_4|A Wandering Crow?{***};;
dlga_ramun_introduce_4:ramun_introduce_5|Aye, a Wandering Crow. The lines are running thin these days, and we need all the men we can get.{***};;
dlga_ramun_introduce_5:ramun_introduce_6|So... you roam the Seven Kingdoms collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and take them back to the wall as eager recruits?{***};;
dlga_ramun_introduce_6:ramun_introduce_7|Aye. Well, it's not all of 'em done bad things.  Some of 'em just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em highborn lads looking for glory.{***};;
dlga_ramun_introduce_7:ramun_introduce_8|And why would they join the Watch?{***};;
dlga_ramun_introduce_8:ramun_introduce_9|Mostly in return for sanction for crimes they've committed.  Some of 'em even volunteer to join the Night's Watch.  The Wall's lines are becoming thinner each day, because of this I would be willing to offer a small fee for any prisoners you may have.{***};;
dlga_ramun_introduce_9:ramun_introduce_10|Hmm, a small fee? {***};;
dlga_ramun_introduce_10:ramun_introduce_11|Aye, a few silver stags for each head you bring me, alive of course. The Watch don't much care who they are or where they come from.{***};;
dlga_ramun_introduce_11:ramun_introduce_12|Hmm, I'll think about it.{***};;
dlga_ramun_introduce_12:close_window|Good. Come back and see me when you've made up ya mind. The more men the better, there's been strange rumours of late from beyond the Wall.{***};;
dlga_start:ramun_talk|Hail fellow well met, {playername}.{***};;
dlga_ramun_pre_talk:ramun_talk|Anything else?{***};;
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_sell_prisoners|I have some prisoners you can take.{***};;
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners:ramun_sell_prisoners_2|Are you sure you want to hand them all over?{***};;
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_2:ramun_sell_prisoners_3|I am sure.{***};;
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_2:ramun_talk|On second thoughts, no.{***};;
dlga_ramun_sell_prisoners_3:close_window|Thanks, my {lad/lassie} the Night's Watch betters due to your contributions.{***};;
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_ask_about_capturing|How did you come to join the Night's Watch?{***};;
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_have_blunt_weapon|New to this, aren't ya? Lemme explain it in simple terms. The basic rule of takin' someone prisoner is knockin' 'em down with a blunt weapon, like a mace or a club, rather than cuttin' 'em open with a sword. That way 'em go to sleep for a little while rather than bleeding to death, ya see? I'm assumin' ya've a blunt weapon with ya, {lad/lassie}.{***};;
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Of course.{***};;
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no|As a matter of fact, I don't.{***};;
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|Good. Then all ya need to do is beat those bastards down with ya weapon, and when the fightin's over ya clamp 'em in irons. It's a bit different for nobles and such, 'em tend to be protected enough that it won't matter what kind of weapon ya use, but ya average rabble-rousers will bleed like a stuck pig if ya get 'em with somethin' sharp, and a dead rabble-rouser is no good to anyone.{***};;
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2|No? Heh, well, this must be ya lucky day, {lad/lassie}. I've got an old club here ya can use. It's a bit battered, but still good enough to bludgeon someone until he stops movin'. Here, take it.{***};;
dlga_ramun_have_blunt_weapon_no_2:ramun_have_blunt_weapon_yes|Thanks, Yoren. Perhaps I may try my hand at it.{***};;
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing:ramun_ask_about_capturing_2|I was young, saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. Weren't much of a villain, the man who stabbed him.{***};;
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_2:ramun_ask_about_capturing_3|You knew who it was?{***};;
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_3:ramun_ask_about_capturing_4|Willem, the last name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watchin' my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face any more, but Willem, oh, he's a nice-lookin' lad: good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins the lassies like.{***};;
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_4:ramun_ask_about_capturing_5|......{***};;
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_5:ramun_ask_about_capturing_6|I would think about him when I was workin',  when I was drinkin', when I was havin' a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed.   Willem, Willem, Willem... a prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came ridin' back into town, and I buried an axe so deep into his skull, they'd to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall, and I've been wearin' the black ever since.{***};;
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_6:ramun_ask_about_capturing_7|... and then you became a wandering crow?{***};;
dlga_ramun_ask_about_capturing_7:ramun_pre_talk|An injury to the shoulder. They said I couldn't longer fight well! So, for the past 30 years I've been recruiting for my brothers instead.{***};;
dlga_ramun_talk:ramun_leave|I'd better be going.{***};;
dlga_ramun_leave:close_window|Remember, any prisoners ya've got, bring 'em to me and the watch will be grateful for it.{***};;

dlga_manhunter_talk_b1:close_window|I knew it! Come on, lads! Let's go get these bastards! Thanks a lot, friend.{***};;
dlga_manhunter_talk_b:manhunter_talk_b2|No, haven't seen any outlaws lately.{***};;

dlga_npc18_pretalk:pj_talk|Yes?{***};;
dlga_pj_talk:close_window|No matter, I'm leaving.{***};;
dlga_pj_talk:pj_talk2|Hello, who are you? You were not born in the Seven Kingdoms, that I can tell.{***};;
dlga_pj_talk2:pj_talk3|I'm a Good Master. My homeland Astopor is located in Southern Essos.{***};;
dlga_pj_talk3:pj_talk4|Southern Essos? Have you tried the beer here? - You shout the maid for two beers -{***};;
dlga_pj_talk4:close_window|Pah, you can't even afford the price of a beer, let alone the price of my soldiers!{***};;
dlga_pj_talk4:pj_talkcado|Yes. Astopor is a City situated in Slaver's Bay. I'm here on business. You may have noticed Qohor's city guard is made up of Unsullied? Proper warriors, not like here, where you're nothing more than little girls. - The Good Master laughs. -The Unsullied are trained from birth, and only one out of four survives to become a soldier: the weak die while the strong go on to live a life of no feelings, no fear of death, and no morals. Before their training ends, they're ordered to kill a child to help them forget all humanity. They're renowned for their utter discipline on the battlefield.{***};;
dlga_pj_talkcado:pj_talk5|All Unsullied are slaves and can be traded.{***};;
dlga_pj_talk3:close_window|Very good, but I must leave. Farewell.{***};;

dlga_pj_talk5:pj_talk6.1|You are mad!{***};;
dlga_pj_talk5:pj_talk71|I would like to hire some Unsullied.{***};;
dlga_pj_talk6:cado_bye|You dare to insult me?! You'll now pay for your misdeeds!{***};;
dlga_pj_talk71:close_window|Come back when I've had the time to train more Unsullied.{***};;
dlga_pj_talk71:pj_dilema|Yes. But remember: the Unsullied are elite troops, trained from childhood to be ruthless and efficient warriors. If you want, I can trade you a small company of 50 men, but you must pay me 75,000 silver stags. Alright?{***};;
dlga_pj_dilema:close_window|Hmm, I was merely curious. Farewell.{***};;
dlga_pj_dilema:close_window.1|Hmm, It seems I'm unable to lead any more men.{***};;
dlga_pj_dilema:pj_dilema2|Sure. Take the money. I'm eager to see them in battle.{***};;
dlga_pj_dilema2:close_window|Come back when you've some coin to spend, beggar!{***};;

dlga_start:geoffrey_talk_new|Ah, {playername}. It's good to see you again. I hope you've been practising those skills of yours since our last encounter.{***};;

dlga_geoffrey_talk_5:geoffrey_hostile|HAH! You think you scare me with your stories of fame and conquest? I spit on you!{***};;
dlga_geoffrey_hostile:geoffrey_hostile_4|Arghh! I'll have your head for that insult, scum! Outside the town walls at noon. Or are you too coward to face me in the field?!{***};;

dlga_hareck_talk:hareck_troublemakers|Is something wrong? You look worried.{***};;
dlga_hareck_talk:close_window|Nothing. Farewell.{***};;
dlga_hareck_troublemakers:hareck_troublemakers_2|Oh, it's nothing, just...{***};;
dlga_hareck_troublemakers_2:hareck_troublemakers_3|You can tell me, ser.{***};;
dlga_hareck_troublemakers_3:hareck_troublemakers_4|No harm in it, I suppose. The trouble is, a few of the foreigners...those Ironmen from across the sea.

dlga_hareck_troublemakers_4:hareck_troublemakers_5|Hmm... would there be a reward for solving this problem?{***};;
dlga_hareck_troublemakers_5:hareck_troublemakers_6|What? What are you saying?{***};;
dlga_hareck_troublemakers_6:hareck_troublemakers_7|Nothing, ser. However, it sounds to me like a neutral third party might be justwhat you need. I could talk to them.{***};;
dlga_hareck_troublemakers_7:hareck_troublemakers_8|Heh. Well, you can try, {lad/lassie}. If you manage to do any good, I'll even throw in afew coins for getting the sand out of my breeches. Their leader is an Ironborn captain called Dagmer Cleftjaw, spends most of his timedrinking wine and fucking whores. Chances are you'll find him nearby.{***};;
dlga_hareck_troublemakers_8:close_window|Thank you, ser. I'll return after I've solved your problem.{***};;
dlga_hareck_talk:hareck_troublemakers_10|Ser, those Ironmen shouldn't be a problem any longer.{***};;
dlga_hareck_troublemakers_10:hareck_troublemakers_11|Truly? Thank you, {lad/lassie}! A few more days and I would've thrown them all into a cell and castaway the key. Here, take this. You've earned it.{***};;

dlga_celidon_beric1:celidon_beric2|You have?!{***};;
dlga_celidon_beric2:celidon_beric3|Of course. You know, it matters not whose cloak you wear: Lannister, Stark, or Baratheon. If you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood Without Banners will hunt you down.{***};;
dlga_celidon_beric3:celidon_beric4|Me? Pray on the weak? You've got the wrong {guy/woman}.{***};;
dlga_celidon_beric3:close_window|Pah... I prey on whom I choose. You think you can stop me?!{***};;
dlga_celidon_beric4:celidon_beric5|Maybe... but then, maybe not. You could prove your innocence by completing a small task.{***};;

dlga_celidon_beric5:close_window|No thanks.{***};;

dlga_member_background_recap_3:do_member_trade|Then shortly after, I joined up with you.{***};;
dlga_do_member_view_char:member_talk|Anything else?{***};;
dlga_member_kingsupport_1:do_member_trade|Um... yes. I've heard so.{***};;
dlga_member_kingsupport_1:member_kingsupport_1a|{s21}{***};;
dlga_member_kingsupport_1a:member_kingsupport_2|Would you then support my cause?{***};;
dlga_member_kingsupport_1a:do_member_trade|Very good. I shall keep that in mind.{***};;
dlga_member_kingsupport_2:do_member_trade|I would, {s21}. Moreover, I have a proposal on how I might help you attain the Iron Throne. But you've recently sent {s22} off on a similar mission. Perhaps we should wait for a couple of weeks to avoid drawing too much attention to ourselves.{***};;
dlga_member_kingsupport_3a:member_kingsupport_4|Very good. You do that.{***};;
dlga_member_kingsupport_3a:do_member_trade|On second thought, stay with me for a while.{***};;
dlga_member_kingsupport_4:close_window|Farewell then, {s21}, for a little while.{***};;
dlga_member_improverels_1:member_improverels_2|What settlement do you have in mind?{***};;
dlga_member_improverels_2:do_member_trade|Actually, forget about this, maybe later.{***};;
dlga_member_improverels_3:close_window|Very well. I will travel there and try to improve your relations with {s4}, {s21}.{***};;
dlga_member_intelgathering_1:member_intelgathering_3|{s21}{***};;
dlga_member_intelgathering_3:member_intelgathering_3|Of course, as few people should know of this as possible. If you want to collect the information, or pull me out, then don't send a messenger. Come and get me yourself - even if that means you have to sneak through the gates.{***};;
dlga_member_intelgathering_3:member_intelgathering_4|Splendid idea - you do that.{***};;
dlga_member_intelgathering_3:do_member_trade|Actually, hold off for now.{***};;
dlga_member_intelgathering_4:close_window|Good. I should be ready to report in about five days. Farewell then, {s21}, for a little while.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_4_start:close_window|Those bastards are attacking anyone associated with House Stark! You must help us fight!{***};;
dlga_start:relative_saved_1a|Thank you! Thank you, {ser/my lady}, for rescuing me from those fiends. Did my brother in {s9} put you onto their track?{***};;
dlga_relative_saved_1a:close_window|Yes. I told him that I would find you. I advise you to return to your family as quickly as you can... and be careful on the road.{***};;
dlga_start:bandit_leader_1a|Frith! Frith! Spare me! Spare my life! Let me go, good {ser/madam}}, and I'll go far away from here and learn an honest trade, and you'll never hear of me again!{***};;
dlga_bandit_leader_1a:bandit_leader_1b|I'll spare your life, but in exchange I want information. Either you or your mates have kidnapped the brother of a prominent merchant in town. Tell me where you're hiding him, and give me your word that you'll stop troubling the people of these parts. Then you can go free.{***};;
dlga_start:looter_leader_1|What do you want?{***};;
dlga_looter_leader_1:looter_leader_2|I've been looking for you. Tell me where you keep your prisoners, and I'll let you go.{***};;
dlga_looter_leader_1:close_window|Nothing. We'll leave you in peace.{***};;
dlga_looter_leader_2:looter_leader_3|Hah! Those prisoners are only going free if you pay their ransom. I want silver stags! A lot of them! Did you bring any coins?{***};;
dlga_looter_leader_3:close_window|No. The only thing I've brought is steel.{***};;
dlga_bandit_leader_1b:close_window|Oh bless you, {ser/my lady}. Bless you. We've done the lad no harm. We've been keeping him in our hideout near {s9}. I'll describe the area nearby in detail, so there's no mistaking it...{***};;
dlga_start:rescue_prisoner_succeed_2|{playername}, you saved him! Thank you ever so much for rescuing my {s11}. Please, take this as some small repayment for your noble deed.{***};;
dlga_rescue_prisoner_succeed_2:lord_pretalk|Always an honour to serve, {s65}.{***};;
dlga_start_up_quest_1_next:close_window|Are you all right? Well... I guess you're alive, at any rate. I'm not sure that we can say the same for the other fellow. That's one less thief to trouble our streets at night, damn bastards are everywhere. Let's talk more inside.{***};;
dlga_start:merchant_quest_2a|Splendid work. You've hired enough men to take on the bandits. Now, travellers entering {s9} have told us that there's a small group of robbers lurking on the outside of town. I suspect that they're all from the same band, the one that took my brother. Hunt them down and defeat them, and make them disclose the location of their lair!{***};;
dlga_start:merchant_quest_3a|So, you've found out where they hid my brother? Splendid work. I flatter myself that I'm a fine judge of character, and you look to be a {man/woman} who can get things done. Now, go out and save his unworthy hide!{***};;
dlga_start:merchant_quest_3b|Well... my brother is home safe. I'm not sure what to do with him - maybe pack him off to King's Landing. That way, if he gets knocked on the head in a street brawl, no one can say it's my fault. But that's not your problem. Here's the rest of your reward. It's well-earned.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_3b:merchant_quest_4a|The money is most welcome, and I'm glad to have been of service.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_4a:merchant_quest_4b|Good! Now... are you interested in making some more money?{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_4b:merchant_quest_4b1|Possibly. What do you need?{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_4b1:merchant_quest_4b2|Remember how I told you that the bandits had an ally inside the walls? I think I know who it is: the captain of the watch, no less. Some months ago, this captain, seeing the amount of profit we merchants were making from trade across the frontiers, decided to borrow some money to sponsor a caravan. Unfortunately, like many who are new to commerce, he failed to realize that great profit only comes with great risk. So, he sank all his money into the most expensive commodities, and, of course, his caravan was captured and looted, and he lost everything.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_4b2:merchant_quest_4b3|As a consequence, it seems our captain's turned to villainy to recoup his fortune. I supposed I'd do the same if, the Seven forbid, I ever faced indebtedness and ruination. Now, any watch captain worth his salary will have a few thieves and robbers on his payroll, to inform on the rest, but our captain decides to employ these bastards wholesale. He brings them into the town, lets them do as they will, and takes a share of their take. You've heard of poachers turning gamekeepers? Well, in these unfortunate lands, sometimes gamekeepers will turn poacher as well. Luckily, there are still a few brave, honest souls in the watch who've told me how he works.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_4b3:merchant_quest_4b4|Now, here's my plan. I could bring this to the attention of {s4}, lord of the city, but that would mean an inquiry, my word against the captain's, and witnesses can be bought and evidence destroyed, or maybe the whole thing will be forgotten if the enemy comes across the border again, and all I'll get for my trouble is a knife in the ribs. In time of war, you see, a king's eye wanders far from his domain, and his subjects suffer. So I've got another idea. I've got a small group of townsfolk together, some men in my employ and some others who've lost relatives to these bandits, and we'll storm the captain's home and bring him in chains before {s4}, hopefully with a few captured bandits to explain how things stack up.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_4b4:merchant_quest_4b5|All I need now is someone to lead my little army into battle, and I can't think of anyone better than you. So, what do you say?{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_4b5:merchant_quest_4b6|How do I know that you're telling me the truth?{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_4b6:merchant_quest_4b7|Oh, well, I suppose it's possible that I found a dozen bandits who were willing to give their lives to give a passing stranger a false impression of life in old {s4}... well, I guess you can't really know if my word is good, but I reckon you've learned by now that my money is good, and there's another 100 silver stags, or maybe a bit more, that's waiting for you if you'll do me this last little favour. So, what do you say?{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_4b7:merchant_quest_4b8|All right. I'll lead your men.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_4b7:merchant_quest_4_decline|I'm sorry. This is too much, too fast. I need time to think.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_4b8:merchant_quest_4b9|Splendid. It's been a long time since I staked so much on a single throw of the dice, and frankly I find it exhilarating. My men are ready to move on your word. Are you ready?{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_4b9:merchant_quest_4_accept|Yes. Give them the sign.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_4b9:merchant_quest_4_decline|Not now. I'll need to rest before I can fight again.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_4_accept:close_window|Good! Strike hard, strike fast, and the captain and his henchmen won't know what hit them. May the Seven be with you!{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_4_decline:close_window|Right. I can keep my men standing by. If you let this go too long, then I suppose that I'll have to finish this affair without you, but I'd be most pleased if you could be part of it as well. For now, take what time you need.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_2a:close_window|Very well. I'll hunt for bandits.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_2a:merchant_quest_2a_whynotcome|Why don't you come with us?{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_2a_whynotcome:merchant_quest_2a|Because I'm paying you to go and take care of it. That's the short answer. The long answer is that I've got some leads to follow up here in town, and I've just as much a chance of getting knocked on my head as you, if that's what you're asking. But I respect your question. Now, what do you say?{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_2a:close_window.1|I cannot deal with this matter at this time.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_3a:close_window|Very well. I go now to attack the bandits in their lair and find your brother.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_3a:close_window.1|I cannot deal with this matter at this time.{***};;
dlga_start:merchant_quest_persuasion12|Good luck, {ser/my lady}.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_3a:merchant_quest_persuasion|You make a persuasive case. I'm going to help you.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:merchant_quest_2|You make a persuasive case. I'm going to help you.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:merchant_quest_3|You make a persuasive case. I'm going to help you.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion:merchant_quest_4b8|You make a persuasive case. I'm going to help you.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_persuasion12:close_window|Thank you. Farewell.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_2:merchant_quest_2a|Now, go find and defeat that group of bandits.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_3:merchant_quest_3a|Now, go attack that bandit hideout, get my brother back, and show those brigands what happens to those who threaten my household.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.36|Oh... praised be the Seven... am I safe?{***};;
dlga_start:merchant_closing_statement_2|Ah, {playername}. Things didn't go quite so well as I had hoped. {s5} couldn't quite find it in him to overlook my little breach of the peace. Oh, he's grateful enough that I got rid of his crooked captain; a guard who'll let in bandits will let in an enemy army if the price is right, but he can't exactly have me running around here as a lasting reminder of his failure to take care of things himself.{***};
dlga_merchant_closing_statement_2:merchant_closing_statement_3|That hardly seems fair...{***};;
dlga_merchant_closing_statement_3:merchant_closing_statement_4|Fair? This is Westeros, {my boy/my lady}! Kings do what they want, and the rest of us do as they must. He didn't string me up and instead gave me time to sell my properties - even put in a word with the other merchants that they best pay me a fair price, too. That's gracious enough, as kings go, but he's a weak king, as they all are here, and weak kings must always look to their authority first, and justice second. I suppose I'd do the same in his shoes.{***};;
dlga_merchant_closing_statement_4:close_window|Anyway, I wouldn't go rubbing your part in this affair in {s5}'s face; nevertheless, he's taken note of you and decided that you're not worth hanging, and that's something to which I'll raise a glass any day of the week. He might even have work for you, further down the road. Or you can sell your sword to one of his competitors. Anyway, I hope you've learned a bit about what it will take to stay alive in this troubled land, and I suspect that the money you've earned won't go to waste. Good luck.{***};
dlga_merchant_quests_last_word:close_window|I'm preparing to leave town in a short while. It's been an honour to know you, {lad/lassie}. Good luck.{***};;
dlga_member_intel_liaison:member_intel_liaison_results|What have you discovered?{***};;
dlga_start:member_intel_liaison|Greetings, stranger.{***};;
dlga_member_intel_liaison:close_window|It's time to pull you out. Let's leave town separately, but join me soon after.{***};;
dlga_member_intel_liaison:close_window.1|You're doing good work. Stay here for a little longer.{***};;

dlga_start:companion_rehire|My offer to rejoin you still stands, if you'll have me.{***};;
dlga_start:companion_rehire.1|It's good to see you alive, {s5}! {s6}, and I did not know whether you had been captured, or slain, or got away. I've been roaming around since then, looking for you. Shall I get my gear together and rejoin your company?{***};;

dlga_minister_issues:minister_pretalk|There's a matter which needs your attention. The quarrel between {s11} and {s12} has escalated to a point where it has become unseemly. If you do intervene, you risk offending one of the lords. However, if you do nothing, you risk appearing weak. Such are the burdens of kingship, {ser/madam}.{***};;
dlga_minister_issues:minister_talk|{s1} currently does not have a lord. You may wish to keep it this way, as lords will sometimes gravitate towards lieges who have land to offer, but for the time being, no one is collecting any of its rents.{***};;

I should point out though that I'm not very skilled in the ways of politics, and that I'm anxious to return to private life.

dlga_minister_issues:minister_talk.2|If I may offer you a word of advice, my {lord/lady}, it seems that your right to rule as an independent monarch isn't sufficiently recognized, and this may bring us problems further down the road.

dlga_companion_embassy_results:companion_rejoin_response|In his letter, {s12} merely refers to you as {playername}, omitting any title: thus, he willingly disregards your right to rule. The letter implies that he won't recognize you as an equal as long as you lack a court.{***};;

dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_1:pretender_discuss_rebellion_2a|Are you sure you're up to the task, {playername}? Reclaiming my throne will be no simple matter. The lords of our realm have all sworn oaths of homage to {s11}. Such oaths to a usurper are, of course, invalid, and we can expect some of the lords to side with us, but it will be a very tough and challenging struggle ahead.{***};;

dlga_pretender_discuss_rebellion_3:close_window|I've got no doubt that your support for my cause is heartfelt, {playername}, and I am grateful to you for it. But I don't think we've much of a chance of success. If you can gain renown in the battlefield and make a name for yourself as a great warrior, then our friends would not hesitate to join our cause, and our enemies would be wary to take up arms against us.

The time is ripe for us to act! I'll come with you, and together, we're going to topple the usurper {s11} and take the throne from his bloodied hands.

dlga_start:lord_invite_1|{playername}, I've been expecting you. Word has reached my ears of your exploits. Why, I've been hearing such tales of prowess and bravery that my mind was quickly made up. I know that I've found someone worthy of becoming my vassal.{***};;

dlga_Eormenred_historia1:Eormenred_historia2|The Wildlings were causing annoyance in the north: somehow they got past the Wall and pillaged the villages south of it.   Thus, the Night's Watch sent out some rangers to investigate. But what they found wasn't Wildlings to be the problem, but something else entirely.   The men said they found death, cold as ice, and eyes as blue as the sea.   Apparently, Wildlings had been re-animated or such...{***};;
dlga_Eormenred_historia2:Eormenred_historia3|Of the rangers who'd travelled there only one returned, they say you could see the terror in his eyes. As if he'd seen something no living being should ever see.   Probably just scare stories, though. Men talk much when there's nothing else to do, like some damn washerwomen.   Anyway, this ranger fled South and was caught by Stark troops near Winterfell. You know what they do to deserting crows, don't you?   Ned Stark himself beheaded that poor lad, and that's how his watch ended.{***};;

dlga_Eormenred_historia4:Eormenred_historia5|I've got no idea, but I'll tell you this. Whatever it was I certainly wouldn't like to come face to face with it.   This man was loyal, a seasoned ranger. He wouldn't have fled easily: somebody... or something made him lose his senses.   If you're wise enough, you would do well to stay this side of the Wall!{***};;

dlga_lord_kill_local_merchant_let_go_2:lord_pretalk|Piffle! You were supposed to remove him, not give him a sermon and send him on his way. He'd better do as you say, or you'll both regret it. Here, this is half the money I promised you. Don't say a word, {playername}, you're lucky to get even that. I've got little use for {men/people} who cannot even follow simple orders.{***};;
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_completed|Beautiful work, {playername}! You've captured both the spy and his handler, just as I hoped, and the pair are now safely ensconced in my dungeon, waiting to be questioned. My torturer shall be busy tonight!

dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed|Blast and damn you, you stupid fool! I wanted two prisoners, {playername}! What you've brought me is one step short of useless!

dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_half_completed.1|I asked you for two prisoners, {playername}, not one. Two! Still, I suppose you did capture the spy's handler, the more important one of the pair. The spy won't dare return here and proves quite useless to whatever master he served. 'Tis better than nothing. However, you'll understand if I pay you only half the promised reward for what is but half a success.{***};;
dlga_lord_start:lord_follow_spy_failed|Truly, {playername}, you're nothing short of totally incompetent. Failing to capture both the spy and his handler plumbs astonishing new depths of failure. Forget any reward I've offered you. You've done absolutely nothing to earn it.{***};;

dlga_lord_start:lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed|{playername}. I've been waiting patiently for my serfs, yet none have returned. Have you an explanation?

dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1a:lord_pretalk|Hmph, that is hardly an excuse for failure, {playername}. Now if you will excuse me, I need to recruit new men to work these fields before we all starve.{***};;
dlga_lord_bring_back_runaway_serfs_failed_1b:close_window|Hah, now you reveal your true colours, traitor! Your words match your actions all too well. I should never have trusted you.{***};;
dlga_lord_start:lord_runaway_serf_half_completed|You disappoint me, {playername}. There were three groups of serfs that I charged you to return. three. Not {reg17}. I suppose the ones who did come back shall have to work twice as hard to make up for those that got away. As for your reward, {playername}, I'll only pay you for the serfs you returned, not the ones you let fly. Here. Take it, and let this business be done.{***};;
dlga_lord_runaway_serf_half_completed:lord_pretalk|Thank you, {s65}. You are indeed generous.{***};;

dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_3:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_4|Hmm, it might just work... but what of you, my {friend/lady}? The guards won't take kindly to this trickery. You may end up spending some time in this cell yourself.{***};;
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_4:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5a|Not to worry, {s65}. The place is already starting to grow on me.{***};;
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_4:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5b|I'll be fine as long there's an ample reward awaiting me at the end.{***};;
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5a:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_6|You're a brave soul indeed. I won't forget this.{***};;
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_5b:lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_6|Of course, my {friend/lady}, of course! Come to me when you've regained your freedom, and perhaps I'll be able to repay the debt I owe you.{***};;
dlga_lord_rescue_by_replace_offer_6:close_window|Quickly, {s65}, let's change our garments. It's past time you were already away from here.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_pardon_after_oath_renounced|{s66}, I wish to restore my old oath to {s4}.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_after_oath_renounced:lord_pretalk|That's too great a matter for me to decide, {playername}. You should seek out {s4}. Such clemency is his alone to grant or deny.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_after_oath_renounced:lord_ask_pardon_terms|{s11}.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_pretalk|As you like, {s65}. I'll accept your judgement.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_pretalk.1|A shame, {s65}. A shame.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_pretalk.2|Very well, go and die without me.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_after_renounce_peace|Aye, I'm ready.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_terms_rejected|On second thought, no. I don't wish to be in your service again.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_after_renounce_peace.1|Aye, I agree to those terms.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms:lord_ask_pardon_terms_rejected.1|That's too high a price, {s65}. I must decline.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_after_renounce_peace:lord_pretalk|Excellent. Though you've strayed from us, {playername}, it gladdens all our hearts that you've found your way back to the right path. I hereby restore your homage to me. Rise once more as an honoured {man/warrior} in my service.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_terms_rejected:close_window|Then get out of my sight, vile traitor! Begone with you, and don't come back, or I'll see to it that you're punished according to your foul deeds!{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_pardon|I wish to make peace with the {s4}.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk|Do you indeed, {playername}? Then go and trip on your sword. Give us all peace.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.1|{playername}, you're a {lord/lady} without a master, holding lands in your name, with only the barest scrap of a claim to legitimacy. No king in Westeros or Essos would accept a lasting peace with you.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.2|Make peace when I've got you at an advantage? I don't think so, {ser/lady}.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.3|I don't see it as being in my current interest to make peace.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_truce_offer|Yes... I'm weary of fighting you, {playername}. I could offer you a truce of twenty days. If you keep your word and don't molest my lands and subjects, we may talk again.{***};;
dlga_lord_truce_offer:close_window|I accept. Let's stop making war upon each other, for the time being anyway.{***};;
dlga_lord_truce_offer:lord_pretalk|On second thought, such an accord wouldn't be in my interests.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_ask_pardon_2|Hmm. I could use my considerable influence to arrange a pardon for you, {playername}, but there are some who see you as an enemy and will not be satisfied unless you pay tribute. All in all, you'd need to bring no less than {reg16} silver stags to make any friends in {s4}.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.4|Unfortunately, I'm in no position to offer you anything. You must speak to {s7}.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_ask_pardon_2.1|Yes... I've got bigger worries than you or your followers. However, you've wronged my subjects, and wrongs demand proper compensation. For the sum of {reg16} silver stags, I suppose that I could agree to grant you a pardon. What do you say?{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon:lord_pretalk.5|I'm sorry. I'm in no position to offer you a pardon.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_2:lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept|I have the money here. {reg16} silver stags.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_2:lord_ask_pardon_tribue_deny|I fear I cannot pay that much.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept:close_window|Excellent, {playername}. I'll use this to make amends to those poor souls you've wronged, and I'll let it be known that you're no longer an enemy of the {s4}.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_accept:close_window.1|Excellent, {playername}. I'm going to use the coin to smooth the feathers of those that can oppose your pardon, and I'm sure that word will soon spread that you're no longer an enemy of {s4}.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_pardon_tribue_deny:lord_pretalk|Then there's nothing I can do for you, {playername}. No silver, no pardon.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_active_mission_1|About the task you gave me...{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_switch_to_spouse|Let's discuss matters related to our household.{***};;
dlga_lord_switch_to_spouse:lord_pretalk|Let's wait until we're in a hall, my wife, as it's difficult to deal with household inventories and such matters in the open field.{***};;
dlga_lord_switch_to_spouse:spouse_talk|Certainly, my wife.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_start_quest1|Good day your Grace, I have some important news you may be interested in hearing.{***};;
dlga_lord_start_quest1:lord_start_quest_11|I'm listening.{***};;
dlga_lord_start_quest_11:lord_start_quest_21|(You hand over the letter you found){***};;
dlga_lord_start_quest_21:close_window|Interesting indeed, although expected. {playername}, see yourself out. It seems I have work to do.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_start_quest2|My Lord, I have some.. sensitive news to bring to your attention.{***};;
dlga_lord_start_quest2:lord_start_quest_12|Continue..{***};;
dlga_lord_start_quest_12:lord_start_quest_22|We captured a passing raven. The letter it carried bared the seal of the Kings hand. (You hand over the letter){***};;
dlga_lord_start_quest_22:close_window|Hmm. So this is what he thinks eh. {playername} I trust none of the words written here will ever pass your lips. Of course, a Lannister always pays his debts, here's a bag of coin for your trouble.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_start_quest|Your Grace, I have urgent news that needs your attention!{***};;
dlga_lord_start_quest:lord_start_quest_1|Please, continue.{***};;
dlga_lord_start_quest_1:lord_start_quest_2|I've travelled from King's Landing with two of your loyal soldiers. I'm here to tell you that your Lord Father, Eddard Stark, has been taken into Lannister custody for reasons of high treason.{***};;
dlga_lord_start_quest_2:lord_start_quest_3|I thank you for your loyalty in these desperate times, {playername}, though the news has already reached us. I hope you'll join us when we march south on King's Landing. We'll see if Lord Tywin really does shit gold.{***};;
dlga_lord_start_quest_3:lord_start_quest_4|Now, {playername}. If I'm to go to war in the south, I've got a small problem that needs taken care of, of which I ask your help.{***};;
dlga_lord_start_quest_4:lord_start_quest_yes|Sure, I'm willing and, I hope, able. What is it you need to be done, Your Grace?{***};;
dlga_lord_start_quest_4:lord_start_quest_no|Sorry, I don't have the time to run errands for you, Your Grace.{***};;
dlga_lord_start_quest_yes:lord_start_quest_yes2|Some wildling scum have managed to pass the Wall, and my scouts report they've attacked a small farmstead just north of here. I need them delt with quickly before they're able to wreak more havoc among my peasants. My bannermen need to prepare for our march south, so I'm counting on you, {playername}, to act on my behalf in this matter.{***};;
dlga_lord_start_quest_yes2:close_window|I suggest you grab some sleep before heading out. It may also be wise for you to ride with a bodyguard or two: Westeros is a dangerous place to be travelling alone.{***};;
dlga_lord_start_quest_no:close_window|Alright then. You suit yourself.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_starting_quest2_succeed|Your Grace, I've despatched of the wildling raiders and successfully protected the farmers.{***};;
dlga_lord_starting_quest2_succeed:lord_starting_quest2_succeed2|Excellent news. Here's some coin for your efforts.{***};;
dlga_lord_starting_quest2_succeed2:lord_starting_quest2_succeed3|There is one other thing, Your Grace. I spoke to a wildling raider before he died. He was... terrified, as if running from something. He begged me to burn his body once he had passed.{***};;
dlga_lord_starting_quest2_succeed3:lord_starting_quest2_succeed4|These wildlings are a superstitious folk. Was anything else mentioned?{***};;
dlga_lord_starting_quest2_succeed4:lord_starting_quest2_succeed5|Only that winter is coming, and along with it death. He also murmured something about White Walkers.{***};;
dlga_lord_starting_quest2_succeed5:lord_starting_quest2_succeed6|These sound more like Old Nans stories. Go to Castle Black, find the Lord Commander and see if he can shed any light on the situation. Oh, and give him this scroll.{***};;
dlga_lord_starting_quest2_succeed6:lord_talk|Yes, Your Grace, I'll leave as soon as I'm ready.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_starting_quest2_fail|Your Grace, they were too many. The farmers, children, women... they're all dead. I'm afraid I've failed you.{***};;
dlga_lord_starting_quest2_fail:lord_starting_quest2_fail2|Then I was too quick to presume you were a capable leader. I've no more need for you and your failures, {playername}.{***};;
dlga_lord_starting_quest2_fail2:lord_starting_quest2_fail3|I'm sorry, Your Grace. It won't happen again. Please allow me a chance to redeem myself and restore your faith in me.{***};;
dlga_lord_starting_quest2_fail3:lord_starting_quest2_fail4|Very well, {playername}, but if you fail me again, we won't be talking on such favourable terms. I hope I've made that clear enough!{***};;
dlga_lord_starting_quest2_fail4:lord_starting_quest2_fail5|Of course, Your Grace. I won't fail you again.{***};;
dlga_lord_starting_quest2_fail5:lord_starting_quest2_fail6|We received a raven from the Wall yesterday. It seems the black brothers require more men for some reason or other. Go to the Wall and find the Lord Commander and see if he can shed some light on the situation. Oh, and give him this scroll.{***};;
dlga_lord_starting_quest2_fail6:lord_talk|Yes Your Grace. I'll leave as soon as I'm ready.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_btb_quest|Your Grace, I have been ordered by the Lord Commander of the Nights Watch to request more men for the wall.{***};;
dlga_lord_btb_quest:lord_btb_quest2|I'm afraid we have no men to spare. We are at war in the south and all my men are accounted for. Tell the Lord Commander I humbly regret I cannot help.{***};;
dlga_lord_btb_quest2:lord_btb_quest3|The situation seemed pretty dire my lord. Are you sure there is nothing you can do?{***};;
dlga_lord_btb_quest3:lord_btb_quest4|As soon as the war is over I can send men to aid at the wall, but until then my men are otherwise engaged.{***};;
dlga_lord_btb_quest4:close_window|Very well your grace, I shall regretfully pass on the message.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_10_bridge_of_skulls|My Lord, I have terrible news. We were unable to repel the attack at the bridge.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_bridge_of_skulls:lord_10_bridge_of_skulls1|Damnit {boy/girl}! You must return to the King of the North at once and tell him I need more men!{***};;
dlga_lord_10_bridge_of_skulls1:close_window|Of course my Lord. I shall leave right away.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_10_bridge_of_skulls_s|My Lord, We have repelled the attack at the bridge. That should hold them for a while.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_bridge_of_skulls_s:lord_10_bridge_of_skulls_s1|Very good {playername}. Now you must get some rest, you must be exhausted. Once you're ready you must return to the King of the North and tell him I need more men. I fear the Wall will not hold much longer.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_bridge_of_skulls_s1:close_window|Of course my Lord. I shall leave right away.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_10_starting_quest|My Lord, I have been sent on request of King Robb Stark. He's asked me to deliver this message.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_starting_quest:lord_10_starting_quest1|Hmm.. let me see. Well {boy/girl}, it seems you are to help the men of the Night's Watch.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_starting_quest1:lord_10_starting_quest2|What?! It can't. He wouldn't.. would he?{***};;
dlga_lord_10_starting_quest2:lord_10_starting_quest3|Heheh don't worry {boy/girl}, you will just return a message to the King of the North. Tell him we've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones we catch... say they've seen the White Walkers.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_starting_quest3:lord_10_starting_quest4|The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_starting_quest4:lord_10_starting_quest5|You must insist King Robb Stark sends more men immediately. When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_starting_quest5:lord_10_starting_quest6|There is one other thing you could help us with {playername}. Our scouts have reported a wildling raiding party heading towards the Bridge of Skulls. You must liaise with our host and make sure they do not pass that bridge. To get there you must follow the wall West until you reach the waters edge. Good luck {playername}.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_starting_quest6:close_window|Very well, I shall leave at once.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_10_lands_of_always_winter_s|My Lord, We have dire news. These creatures... the rumours you spoke of, it's all true.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_lands_of_always_winter_s:lord_10_lands_of_always_winter_s1|If they are indeed true then more will surely be coming. We must prepare {playername}! It's up to you how you proceed from here on in, but I beg you rally the realm and bring an army to the wall as soon as you can. It will only be a matter of time before these creatures show up again.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_lands_of_always_winter_s1:close_window|Of course my Lord. I shall do as I must.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_10_btb_quest|My Lord, I have unfortunate news. I was unable to strike a deal for reinforcements. War is raging in the South and I am told the men are needed there instead.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_btb_quest:lord_10_btb_quest1|Well, this is most unfortunate. I fear we will not last long if the Wildings decide to attack our walls and I have heard rumours of an even bigger threat stirring in the depths of the far north.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_btb_quest1:lord_10_btb_quest2|I'm afraid it's up to you now {playername}. I shall need you to gather a small army and scout the lands of always winter and see what truth these rumours hold.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_btb_quest2:lord_10_btb_quest3|Jon Snow will accompany you. He holds a Valyrian weapon and if the rumours are indeed true then mere mortal weapons will be useless against these creatures. He knows the lands north of the wall better than anyone and he can vouch for anything you witness whilst out there.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_btb_quest3:lord_10_btb_quest4|Very well Lord Commander.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_btb_quest4:close_window|I thank you again {playername} for your continued devotion to the realms of men. I pray the old gods and the new keep you safe.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_10_craster_keep|I received the raven you sent.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_craster_keep:lord_10_craster_keep1|Ah, {playername}. I was hoping you would come. I have unfortunate news about Commander Mormont. His party has been slain at Craster's keep including Commander Mormont himself.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_craster_keep1:lord_10_craster_keep2|I need the men responsible dealt with swiftly. We don't have the numbers to organise an assault so instead I'm hoping you are able to take care of this matter for me. You have been invaluable to us in the past and this is why I look to rely on you again.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_craster_keep2:close_window|Of course my Lord. These men will pay dearly for this.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_10_crasters_keep_complete|My Lord, The men have been dealt with.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_crasters_keep_complete:lord_10_crasters_keep_complete1|Very good {playername}. I knew you could be relied upon.{***};;
dlga_lord_10_crasters_keep_complete1:close_window|Of course my Lord.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_request_mission_ask|Do you have any tasks for me?{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:combined_political_quests|Do you think we can work together to advance our standings in this realm?{***};;
dlga_combined_political_quests:lord_pretalk|I don't imagine that the both of us have many mutual interests.{***};;
dlga_combined_political_quests:lord_pretalk.1|Hmm... perhaps we can discuss this matter in a more private setting, at a later date.{***};;
dlga_combined_political_quests:lord_pretalk.2|Hmm... I do have an idea, but it would require you to be free of any controversy. If you were to wait some time without getting into any arguments with the other lords of our realm, perhaps we could proceed further.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_resign_marshalship|I wish to resign the marshalship.{***};;
dlga_lord_ask_resign_marshalship:lord_pretalk|So be it. I'll have to find someone else then.{***};;
dlga_lord_request_enlistment:nw_join_01|So you wish to join the Watch eh.{***};;
dlga_nw_join_01:nw_join_03|Joining the Watch is no joke, boy. You are completely serious that you wish to aid us in our duties?{***};;
dlga_nw_join_01:nw_join_02|Sorry to say, but we only accept men here in the Watch. You can't join us.{***};;
dlga_nw_join_02:lord_pretalk|Damn, then I shall aid you in other ways.{***};;
dlga_nw_join_03:nw_join_04|I am serious.{***};;
dlga_nw_join_03:lord_pretalk|No, pardon me, I don't know what I was thinking.{***};;
dlga_nw_join_04:nw_join_05|Very well. Tell me about yourself then.{***};;
dlga_nw_join_05:nw_join_06|I've not got much, but I'm willing.{***};;
dlga_nw_join_05:nw_join_07|I've seen my share of this world. I can help.{***};;
dlga_nw_join_05:nw_join_08|I'm a respected person and wish to aid the land.{***};;
dlga_nw_join_05:nw_join_09|No doubt you've heard of me. I'm {playername) the Great!{***};;
dlga_nw_join_05:nw_join_10|I'm a lord among men and expect to join as an officer.{***};;
dlga_nw_join_06:nw_join_11|Aye, much the same as most who join us nowadays. We'll start you off as a trainee. Get your bearings in the yard, and we'll see if we can make a brother out of you.{***};;
dlga_nw_join_07:nw_join_11|We can use all the help we can get. Join us and take the oath, and when your vigil begins it shall be as a true brother of the Night's Watch.{***};;
dlga_nw_join_08:nw_join_11|Well, that’s a fine thing to hear. The Night's Watch is always in need of able souls. Tell me, what takes your fancy? The bow or the blade?{***};;
dlga_nw_join_09:nw_join_11|Aye, now that I think about it. Caused quite a bit of commotion in a short time, so you have. If you wish to become a brother of the Night's Watch then all the better. Lost a few of our finest in a skirmish just the other day, so you can take their gear. The Watch wastes nothing.{***};;
dlga_nw_join_10:nw_join_11|Good, always a grand thing to see a mighty lord join the Watch. We'll welcome you into our ranks as no less than a senior officer – the Gods Old and New know that we need all that we can get.{***};;
dlga_nw_join_11:close_window|Thankyou my lord.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:ff_join_q_01|I've destroyed the Night's Watch patrol and bring back their armour as proof.{***};;
dlga_ff_join_q_01:ff_join_q_02|Indeed. I'm impressed, {playername}. You can keep the armour; I've no use for it. Best go and burn it somewhere.{***};
dlga_ff_join_q_02:lord_give_conclude|You've proven yourself worthy of my trust, {playername}. From this day forth may you be known as one of the Free Folk, and may your blade strike fear in the hearts of our enemies.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:ff_join_01|{s66}, I wish to join your cause.{***};;
dlga_ff_join_01:close_window|I see you haven't yet destroyed the crow patrol.{***};;
dlga_ff_join_01:ff_join_02|Hmm? Is it so? Well, {lad/lassie}, we wouldn't deny you the right to fight for us if you're willing.{***};;
dlga_ff_join_02:ff_join_03|However, I want to be certain that you're indeed willing to join us. Life here is harsh, and I need to be certain you're fit for the task of helping us.{***};;
dlga_ff_join_03:ff_join_04|I want you to prove yourself first. Like a little challenge of sorts. What do you think?{***};;
dlga_ff_join_04:ff_join_06|A challenge?{***};;
dlga_ff_join_04:ff_join_05|Forget it.{***};;
dlga_ff_join_05:lord_pretalk|As you wish. But I knew you weren't up to the task.{***};;
dlga_ff_join_06:ff_join_07|Yes, exactly. I want you to hunt down and destroy a ranger patrol of the Night's Watch. They keep slaughtering our people, and I want you to prove yourself by taking your sword to our enemies. What do you think of it?{***};;
dlga_ff_join_07:ff_join_08|As you command.{***};;
dlga_ff_join_07:ff_join_05|Forget it.{***};;
dlga_ff_join_08:lord_talk|Very well then, {lad/lassie}. You've got one week to destroy a Watch patrol. And after you're done with them, bring me one of their tunics as proof. Now go.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:close_window|Hmm... maybe we can talk, warrior to warrior.{***};;
dlga_lord_request_enlistment:lord_request_enlistment_confirm|I've got room in my ranks for a {man/woman} of your disposition, {playername}. I can take you on as a {s1}, with a weekly pay of {s2} and food, of course. Plenty of room for promotion, and you'll be equipped as befits your rank. You'll have your take of what you can scavenge in battle as well. What do you say?{***};;
dlga_lord_request_enlistment_confirm:close_window|Seems a fair lot and steady work in these lands. I'm with you, my lord.{***};;
dlga_lord_request_enlistment_confirm:lord_pretalk|Well, on second thought, my lord, I might try my luck alone a bit longer. My gratitude.{***};;
dlga_lord_request_enlistment:lord_pretalk|I don't trust you enough to allow you to serve me.{***};;
dlga_lord_request_retire:lord_pretalk|Very well, {playername}. You're relieved of your duty.{***};;
dlga_lord_request_vacation:lord_pretalk|Very well {playername}. You shall take some time off from military duty. Return in two weeks.{***};;
dlga_lord_request_vacation:lord_pretalk.1|You want to break the oath you've sworn to the Night's Watch, {playername}? I'm afraid I can't let you do that.{***};;
dlga_lord_request_vacation:lord_pretalk.2|I see you cannot handle the pressures of battle and need a little rest, {playername}? No chance, now get back in line soldier.{***};;
dlga_ask_return_from_leave:lord_pretalk|Welcome back, {playername}. Your regiment has missed you I dare say. Now return to your post.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_enter_service|{s66}, I've come to offer you my sword in vassalage!{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_ask_enter_service.1|{s66}, I wish to become your sworn {man/woman} and fight for your honour.{***};;

dlga_lord_talk:lord_talk_preoffer|I've got an offer for you.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_give_troops|I want to give some troops to you.{***};;
dlga_lord_give_troops:lord_pretalk|Well, I could use some good soldiers. Thank you.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_give_order_ask|I have a new task for you.{***};;
dlga_lord_talk:lord_give_suggestion_ask|May I suggest a course of action?{***};;

dlga_lord_ask_enter_service_female_solution_competitor:lord_ask_enter_service_female_response|Oh, perhaps you might find someone who was truly desperate - but then, I dare to say, he wouldn't have many fiefs to bestow. Do you have any other questions?{***};;

dlga_lord_collect_taxes_success:lord_pretalk|Well done, {playername}, very well done indeed! You were truly the right {man/person} for the job.

dlga_lord_collect_taxes_half_success:lord_pretalk|What?! Is this some scheme of yours, {playername}? That's less than half the taxes I'm owed!

dlga_lord_leave:close_window.3|Yes, yes. Farewell.{***};;
dlga_lord_leave:close_window.4|We will meet again.{***};;
dlga_member_chat:lady_journey_1|Are you enjoying the journey, {s65}?{***};;
dlga_lady_journey_1:close_window|I am doing quite fine, {playername}. Thank you for your concern.{***};;
dlga_start:spouse_talk|Yes, my husband?{***};;
dlga_spouse_talk:minister_issues|As you are my chief minister, I wish to speak to about affairs of state{***};;
dlga_spouse_talk:offer_gift_quest_complete|I have the materials for {s4}'s gift.{***};;
dlga_offer_gift_quest_complete:close_window.1|Ah, let me take those. Hopefully this will mend the quarrel between you two. You may wish to speak to {reg4?her:him}, and see if I had any success.{***};;
dlga_spouse_talk:spouse_cancel_political_quest|Let's abandon our plan to {s10}.{***};;
dlga_spouse_cancel_political_quest:spouse_cancel_political_quest_confirm|Are you sure you want to drop that idea?{***};;
dlga_spouse_cancel_political_quest_confirm:spouse_pretalk|Yes, I am sure. Let's abandon that idea.{***};;
dlga_spouse_cancel_political_quest_confirm:spouse_pretalk.1|Actually, never mind.{***};;
dlga_spouse_talk:combined_political_quests|Let us think of a way to improve our standing in this realm{***};;
dlga_spouse_talk:spouse_organize_feast|I was thinking that perhaps we could host a feast{***};;
dlga_spouse_talk:spouse_household_possessions|Let us take inventory of our household possessions{***};;
dlga_spouse_household_possessions:spouse_pretalk|Anyway, that is the content of our larder.{***};;
dlga_spouse_talk:spouse_show_son2|Finally. Our child is born.{***};;
dlga_spouse_show_son2:spouse_child_name|{s4}{***};;
dlga_spouse_child_name:close_window|The child should stay with his mother. What will you name him?{***};;
dlga_spouse_child_name:close_window.1|The child should stay with her mother. What will you name her?{***};;
dlga_spouse_talk:spouse_show_son|My love. How does the mother of my child fare?{***};;
dlga_spouse_show_son:close_window|{s4}{***};;
dlga_spouse_talk:spouse_show_love|Let us celebrate our love together.{***};;
dlga_spouse_show_love:spouse_show_love_ans1|Of course dear {playername}, what did you have in mind?{***};;
dlga_spouse_show_love_ans1:spouse_spree1|I will have the servants bring us the finest foods and wine, then afterwards.. well, who knows what may happen. (1,000 stags){***};;
dlga_spouse_show_love_ans1:spouse_regalocasual|Today I will shower you, my precious wife, with the most exquisite gifts from throughout the known world. (2,000 stags){***};;
dlga_spouse_show_love_ans1:close_window|Actually, I've changed my mind{***};;
dlga_spouse_regalocasual:close_window|Oh {playername}. You are as generous as you are handsome.{***};;
dlga_spouse_spree1:spouse_nocheloca|Oh {playername}, how wonderfull.{***};;
dlga_spouse_spree1:close_window|Maybe another time. I have too much to attend to.{***};;
dlga_spouse_nocheloca:close_window|... ... ...{***};;
dlga_spouse_show_love:spouse_show_love_ans2|Of course my love, what did you have in mind?{***};;
dlga_spouse_show_love_ans2:spouse_spree2|I shall have the servants bring us some wine. (500 stags){***};;
dlga_spouse_show_love_ans2:close_window|Actually, I've changed my mind.{***};;
dlga_spouse_spree2:close_window|I would like that very much. May I request some Arbor red?{***};;
dlga_spouse_show_love:spouse_show_love_ans3|Our love? As if such thing exists {playername}. Just hand me some stags to allow me to peruse the markets.{***};;
dlga_spouse_show_love_ans3:spouse_spree3|Of course, here's 100 stags.{***};;
dlga_spouse_show_love_ans3:close_window|Actually, I've changed my mind{***};;
dlga_spouse_spree3:close_window|Dont wait up for me.{***};;
dlga_spouse_show_love:spouse_show_love_ans4|Love?! So you be a jester now? Or is it that you think love is for sale?{***};;
dlga_spouse_show_love_ans4:spouse_spree4|I know fine things fit for court for sale. (500 stags).{***};;
dlga_spouse_show_love_ans4:close_window|Actually, I've changed my mind{***};;
dlga_spouse_spree4:spouse_spree44|Are you to insinuate that I'm insufficient for your court?{***};;
dlga_spouse_spree44:spouse_spree4a|{s67}, just enjoy the gift and give me no grief.{***};;
dlga_spouse_spree44:spouse_spree4b|Yes. {s67}, you are a burden to my court.{***};;
dlga_spouse_spree4a:close_window|Very well {playername}. I'll put this to good use.{***};;
dlga_spouse_spree4b:close_window|Pah! What an ass you are {playername},^take your gift and shove it!{***};;
dlga_spouse_talk:spouse_mate|My dear, maybe we should make our way to our bed chambers. I have a somewhat stiff surprise for you.{***};;
dlga_spouse_mate:close_window|{playername} stop, your making me blush!{***};;
dlga_spouse_mate:close_window.1|As you wish my love{***};;
dlga_spouse_mate:close_window.2|If there is no alternative {husband/wife}.{***};;
dlga_spouse_mate:close_window.3|Sorry {playername}, I have a headache. Perhaps something at dinner affects my constitution. Try going to sleep.{***};;
dlga_spouse_mate:close_window.4|I'm tired. Do you not have enemies to kill or something??{***};;
dlga_spouse_talk:close_window|We shall speak later, my {wife/husband}{***};;
dlga_wedding_ceremony_bride_vow:wedding_ceremony_player_vow|My husband, I hear by pledge to be your wife, to stand with you in good times and bad. May the heavens smile upon us and bless us with children, livestock, and land.{***};;
dlga_wedding_ceremony_player_vow:wedding_ceremony_vows_complete|I pledge the same. Let us be husband and wife.{***};;
dlga_wedding_ceremony_player_vow:close_window|Wait -- hold on... I'm not quite ready for this.{***};;
dlga_wedding_ceremony_vows_complete:close_window|I now declare you and {s3} to be husband and wife. Go now to the chamber prepared for you, and we shall make arrangements for your bride to join you in your hall in {s11}.{***};;
dlga_spouse_pretalk:spouse_talk|Is there anything else, my {husband/wife}?{***};;
dlga_spouse_organize_feast:spouse_pretalk|A splendid idea, my {husband/wife}. However, let us wait for the current feast here to conclude, before organizing another.{***};;
dlga_spouse_organize_feast:spouse_pretalk.1|A splendid idea, my {husband/wife}. However, we must establish a court before hosting a feast.{***};;
dlga_spouse_organize_feast:spouse_pretalk.2|A splendid idea, my {husband/wife}. However, our realm has recently had a feast. Perhaps we should wait another {reg3} days before we organize another one.{***};;
dlga_spouse_organize_feast:spouse_evaluate_larder_for_feast|A splendid idea, my {husband/wife}. However, to not insult our guests, we must make sure that we can provide a large and varied repast, for the lords, their families, and their retinues. All told, we should count on a couple of hundred mouths to feed, over several days. Let us take an inventory of our household possessions...{***};;
dlga_spouse_evaluate_larder_for_feast:spouse_feast_confirm|{s9}{***};;
dlga_spouse_feast_confirm:spouse_feast_added_items|Let me add more items to our storehouses{***};;
dlga_spouse_feast_added_items:spouse_evaluate_larder_for_feast|All right -- let me re-evaluate what is there...{***};;
dlga_spouse_feast_confirm:spouse_feast_confirm_yes|Let us dispatch the invitations{***};;
dlga_spouse_feast_confirm:spouse_pretalk|Let us wait, then{***};;
dlga_spouse_feast_confirm_yes:spouse_pretalk|I shall send word, then, that we will host a feast as soon as conditions in the realm permit. You perhaps should continue to stock our larder, so that we may do justice to our reputation for hospitality.{***};;
dlga_spouse_feast_confirm_yes:spouse_pretalk.1|Very well, then. Let the feast begin immediately at our court {reg4?here:} in {s9}. You perhaps should continue to stock our larder, so that we may do justice to our reputation for hospitality. You may declare the feast to be concluded at any time, either by beginning a campaign or by letting it be known that the vassals can return to their homes.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.59|How wonderful it is... In a short while we shall be married! However, I should point out that, in the remaining few days, it is not customary for us to speak too much together.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.60|Em, {playername}, you might not be used to our wedding customs, but I had hoped that someone would tell you... Speak first to my {s11}, {s4}.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.61|I do not know where to find my {s11} {s10}, who by tradition should preside over our wedding. Perhaps we should wait until he can be found...{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.62|The honourable {s12} has agreed to allow us to return home to our families. We shall be departing shortly.{***};;
dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive|So great is my loneliness! How I miss my family!{***};;
dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive.1|You are a cad, {ser/madame}, to hold a lady like this...{***};;
dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive.2|It is strange. On occasion you have shown me such kindness, and yet you continue to hold me here against my will.{***};;
dlga_start:kingdom_lady_captive.3|Why haven't my family paid my ransom? You may hold me as prisoner, but it seems that you care for me more than they do!{***};;
dlga_lady_stranded_next:close_window|Greetings, {ser/my lady}. The tides of war have left me stranded here in this fortress, but I will shortly be departing. {***};;
dlga_start:lady_talk_refugee|{playername} -- I assume that you, as a {man/lady} of honour, will accord gentle-born ladies such as ourselves the right to return to our families, and not demand a ransom.{***};;
dlga_start:lady_escort_lady_succeeded|Thank you for escorting me here, {playername}. Please accept this gift as a token of my gratitude. I hope we shall meet again sometime in the future.{***};;
dlga_lady_escort_lady_succeeded:close_window|It was an honour to serve you, {s65}.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.63|We will shortly depart{s5}. It is good to know that some people in this world retain a sense of honour.{***};;
dlga_lady_talk_refugee:close_window|Of course, my lady{***};;
dlga_lady_talk_refugee:lady_captive_talk|You assume wrong, my lady!{***};;
dlga_lady_captive_talk:lady_captive_confirm|What?! What infamy is this?{***};;
dlga_lady_captive_confirm:close_window|My apologies - you must have misunderstood me. Of course you may leave.{***};;
dlga_lady_captive_confirm:close_window.1|Contact your family to arrange for a ransom, my lady.{***};;
dlga_kingdom_lady_captive:close_window|Then write to your family, and ask them to hurry up with the ransom!{***};;
dlga_kingdom_lady_captive:close_window.1|I have changed my mind -- you are free to go{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.64|Well, {playername} -- you fought a duel with {s10}, and lost. According to our custom and tradition, I should no longer receive you. Farewell, {playername}.{***};;
dlga_start:lady_duel_lost|Oh {playername} -- I heard of your duel with {s10}. I wish now that you had never fought him, for our honour and tradition demand that, having lost to him, you now break off your suit with me. Farewell, {playername}.{***};;
dlga_lady_duel_lost:close_window|Very well - we must do as tradition demands... Farewell, my lady{***};;
dlga_lady_duel_lost:lady_duel_lost_flaunt_conventions|Let honour and tradition hang!{***};;
dlga_lady_duel_lost_flaunt_conventions:close_window|Oh, {playername}! Although people will talk, it would so break my heart to no longer be able to see you. We shall ignore this silly, cruel tradition.{***};;
dlga_lady_duel_lost_flaunt_conventions:close_window.1|No, {playername} -- I cannot afford to fritter away my good name, and neither can you.{***};;
dlga_start:lady_start|Oh, {playername} -- I have heard that you won your duel with {s10}. I'm grateful that you have delivered me from that man's attentions!{***};;
dlga_start:lady_start.1|Well, {playername} --  you won your duel with {s10}. Clearly, he was not worthy of my affections.{***};;
dlga_lady_duel_rep_1:lady_start|Well, {playername} --  you won your duel with {s10}. Oh, such foolishness, that men should fight over me! Sigh... But it is a bit romantic, I suppose.{***};;
dlga_lady_duel_rep_2:lady_start|Well, {playername} --  you won your duel with {s10}. Honour now demands that he and I no longer meet... I was fond of him, you know. You did me no service by fighting him, ser.{***};;
dlga_start:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1|My dear {playername}, how joyous to see you again! I heard you gave that vile {s13} a well-deserved lesson. I hope he never forgets his humiliation. I've a reward for you, but I fear it's little compared to what you've done for me.{***};;
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2|Oh, it will just have to do.{***};;
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2.1|{s66}, this is far too much!{***};;
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_1:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2.2|Please, {s65}, no reward is necessary.{***};;
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_succeeded_2:lady_pretalk|{s10}{***};;
dlga_start:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed|I was told that you sought satisfaction from {s13} to prove my innocence, {playername}. It was a fine gesture, and I thank you for your efforts.{***};;
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed:lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed_2|I beg your forgiveness for my defeat, {s65}...{***};;
dlga_lady_qst_duel_for_lady_failed_2:lady_pretalk|It matters not, dear {playername}. You tried. The truth cannot be proven at the point of a sword, but you willingly put your life at stake for my honour. That alone will convince many of my innocence.{***};;
dlga_start:lady_start.2|Ah {playername} - you must have received my message. How happy I am that you could come!{***};;
dlga_start:lady_proposal_pending|{playername} - is there any word from my family?{***};;
dlga_start:lady_betrothed|I hear that my {s11} has refused your request to marry me. Does that mean that we must part?{***};;
dlga_start:lady_generic_mission_succeeded|Oh, {playername}, you brought him back to me! Thank you ever so much for rescuing my {s11}. Please, take this as some small repayment for your noble deed.{***};;
dlga_start:rescue_prisoner_succeed_1|Oh, {playername}, you brought him back to me! Thank you ever so much for rescuing my {s11}. Please, take this as some small repayment for your noble deed.{***};;
dlga_rescue_prisoner_succeed_1:lady_pretalk|Always an honour to serve, {s65}.{***};;
dlga_start:lady_meet_end|You must be {playername}. We have just had the honour of watching you distinguish yourself in the recent tournament{s8}.{***};;
dlga_start:lady_meet_end.1|You must be {playername}. My {s15} {s16} has spoken most highly of you. I am delighted to make your acquaintance.{***};;
dlga_start:lady_premeet|I say, you don't look familiar...{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.65|Ah, {playername}. How good it is to see you again. However, I believe that I am required elsewhere.{***};;
dlga_start:lady_start.3|{playername} -- how good it is to see you. (Whispers:) I still remember your visits fondly.{***};;
dlga_start:lady_meet_end.2|Ah, {playername}. How splendid it was to see you distinguish yourself in the recent tournament.{***};;
dlga_start:lady_start.4|{s12}{***};;
dlga_lady_start:lady_betrothed|I have sad news. I have become betrothed to {s5} -- against my will, I should say! Oh {playername} - I would so much rather be wed to you!{***};;
dlga_lady_start:lady_betrothed.1|Good {playername} -- I have become betrothed to {s5}. It is now no longer seemly for us to see each other like this.{***};;
dlga_lady_start:lady_other_suitor|I must tell you -- there is another lord who has been paying me attentions, although I cannot abide him. I fear he has designs on me, and may try to force me to wed against my will.{***};;
dlga_lady_start:lady_talk|{s11}It is probably not suitable for us to tarry too long here in conversation, but I would hope to see you again soon.{***};;
dlga_lady_start:lady_talk.1|{s11}{***};;
dlga_lady_start:lady_talk.2|I was planning to retire for a little while, but perhaps we may have a chance to speak more later...{***};;
dlga_lady_start:lady_talk.3|It is so delightful to have a chance to spend some time together.{s12}{***};;
dlga_lady_start:lady_talk.4|What brings you here today?{***};;
dlga_lady_proposal_pending:close_window|No word so far...{***};;
dlga_lady_proposal_pending:lady_proposal_pending_end|On second thought, now is not the time for us to marry{***};;
dlga_lady_proposal_pending_end:close_window|{s11}{***};;
dlga_lady_betrothed:lady_suggest_elope|Never! We must elope together at once!{***};;
dlga_lady_betrothed:lady_pretalk|Perhaps I may still be able to change your {s11}'s mind{***};;
dlga_lady_betrothed:lady_conclude_relationship|So be it -- let us then part{***};;
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship|Good {playername} -- you are a good and kind man, but a lady cannot defy her family. Such things are not done!{***};;
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_other_suitor|Ser -- as you may know, I have been entertaining offers from a number of gentlemen such as yourself. I am not yet at a stage where I can commit to any of them.{***};;
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.1|Ah {playername}, you must realize. You are still finding your way in the world. I have great affection for you, {playername}, but I will not consign myself to obscurity.{***};;
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.2|Ah {playername}, although you are kind to me, I am not certain enough of your moral fibre to risk such a thing. Although I bare little affection for my husband, it would be a weighty thing to go against my family's wishes, and I am not certain enough of you to take that step.{***};;
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.3|Good {playername} -- to elope would be to throw away my ties with my family, which are everything to me! I have a considerable affection for you, but I am not sure that I am prepared to risk that.{***};;
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_conclude_relationship.4|Good {playername} -- I am not used to the hardships of campaigning as you are. I want a home to call my own. If you were lord of a castle or town with a great hall, I would gladly go there as your wife, to be mistress of the household. But I do not wish to live like a hunted animal.{***};;
dlga_lady_suggest_elope:lady_elope_agree|Elope with you? Yes -- we could do that. It is a great step to defy my family -- but a loveless marriage, and life without you, might be a far worse thing! But be warned -- this will be a terrible blow to my {s11}'s prestige, and he will do everything in his power to bring you down.{***};;
dlga_lady_elope_agree:lady_elope_agree_nurse|Quickly, then! There is no time to lose.{***};;
dlga_lady_elope_agree:close_window|Everything in his power, you say? Em... Let me think about this...{***};;
dlga_lady_elope_agree_nurse:lady_elope_agree_lady_vows|Your Lordship... Your Ladyship... Would you like me to witness your exchange of vows?{***};;
dlga_lady_elope_agree_lady_vows:lady_elope_agree_nurse_2|Yes, do that. For my part, I make the following vow: I, {s4}, do swear that I accept {playername} as my husband, according to the ancient law and custom of our land...{***};;
dlga_lady_elope_agree_nurse_2:lady_elope_agree_player_vows|Very good. Do you, {playername}, swear similarly to accept {s4} as your wife?{***};;
dlga_lady_elope_agree_player_vows:close_window|I do.{***};;
dlga_lady_elope_agree_player_vows:close_window.1|Eh, what? This is all moving too fast...{***};;
dlga_lady_elope_agree:lady_conclude_relationship|Oh, really? My dear -- I could never separate a lady from her family like that...{***};;
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship:lady_conclude_relationship_confirm|So I suppose our time together must come to an end...{***};;
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship_confirm:lady_conclude_relationship_confirm_yes|Yes -- it must be...{***};;
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship_confirm:lady_conclude_relationship_confirm_no|Wait -- perhaps there is still a chance for us!{***};;
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship_confirm_yes:close_window|Farewell, {playername}. We will see each other, in the courts and castles of this realm, but we must keep our distance from each other. I will remember these days fondly, nonetheless.{***};;
dlga_lady_conclude_relationship_confirm_no:close_window|In that case, we shall see what the future brings.{***};;
dlga_lady_generic_mission_succeeded:lady_pretalk|Always an honour to serve, {s65}.{***};;
dlga_lady_premeet:lady_meet|I am {playername}.{***};;
dlga_lady_premeet:lady_meet.1|My name is {playername}. At your service.{***};;
dlga_lady_meet:lady_meet_end|Of course. How splendid to finally make your acquaintance.{***};;
dlga_lady_meet:lady_meet_end.1|{playername}? I do not believe I've heard of you before.{***};;
dlga_lady_meet_end:lady_talk|I am about to retire for a little while, but perhaps we may have a chance to speak more later...{***};;
dlga_lady_meet_end:lady_talk.1|Now, if you will excuse me...{***};;
dlga_lady_meet_end:lady_talk.2|Can I help you with anything?{***};;
dlga_lady_talk:lord_talk_ask_location|I want to know the location of someone.{***};;
dlga_lady_pretalk:lady_talk|Now, if you will excuse me...{***};;
dlga_lady_pretalk:lady_talk.1|Is there anything else?{***};;
dlga_lady_talk:dplmc_lady_relations2|I wished to ask about one of your relatives.{***};;
dlga_dplmc_lady_relations2:dplmc_lady_info_relative_select|About which lord do you want information?{***};;
dlga_dplmc_lady_info_relative_select:dplmc_lady_info_relative_1|You're {s11} {s18}{***};;
dlga_dplmc_lady_info_relative_select:lady_pretalk|Never mind.{***};;
dlga_dplmc_lady_info_relative_1:lady_pretalk|Pardon, but I do not feel comfortable discussing such personal matters with you.{***};;
dlga_dplmc_lady_info_relative_1:dplmc_lady_info_relative_2|{s47}{***};;

dlga_dplmc_lady_info_relative_2:lady_pretalk.1|{s1}{***};;
dlga_lady_talk:dplmc_lady_feasts|Do you know of any ongoing feasts?{***};;
dlga_dplmc_lady_feasts:lady_pretalk|{s12}{***};;
dlga_lady_talk:lady_relations|May I have the honour of knowing more about you, my lady?{***};;
dlga_lady_relations:lady_pretalk|{s12}{***};;
dlga_lady_talk:lady_profess_admiration|My lady, I would like to profess myself your most ardent admirer{***};;
dlga_lady_talk:lady_tournament_dedication_reaction|My lady, I would like to dedicate my successes in this recent tournament to you{***};;
dlga_lady_tournament_dedication_reaction:lady_pretalk|{s9}{***};;
dlga_lady_profess_admiration:close_window|{s11}I would like it very much if we could see more of each other.{***};;
dlga_lady_profess_admiration:lady_pretalk|Ah... You are too kind... My, the hour is getting rather late, isn't it? I really must be going.{***};;
dlga_lady_talk:lady_recite_poetry|Do you like poetry, my lady?{***};;
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_recite_poetry|That would depend on the poem. Did you intend to recite a verse?{***};;
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_recite_poetry_response|The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun...{***};;
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_recite_poetry_response.1|The lord he came a-riding upon a rainy day...{***};;

dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_recite_poetry_response.4|A bear there was a bear, a bear...{***};;
dlga_lady_recite_poetry:lady_pretalk|Actually, I can't think of any that I would care to recite...{***};;
dlga_lady_recite_poetry_response:lady_private_conversation_end|{s11}{***};;
dlga_lady_private_conversation_end:lady_pretalk|Time is passing quickly, and we cannot linger here too long.{***};;
dlga_lady_talk:lady_marriage_discussion|Do you think that we may have a future together, my lady?{***};;
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:lady_other_suitor|Ser -- as you may know, I have been entertaining offers from a number of gentlemen such as yourself. I am not yet at a stage where I can commit to any of them.{***};;
dlga_lady_marriage_discussion:lady_proposal_refused|It is good to hear that you are thinking seriously about the future. However, I would like to see you rise a little further in the world before I am ready to commit to marry you.{***};;

dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2|According to our laws and traditions, you can do one of several things. First, you could station a garrison here to protect the castle from any immediate counter-attacks, then request an audience with some wealthy lord and ask him to make you an offer. It would be worth a tidy sum, believe you me. If you do not wish to sell, then you will have to find yourself a liege lord and protector who would accept homage from you. Without a royal investiture and an army at your back, you would have a difficult time holding on to the castle. Both you and {s1} would become great big targets for any man with a few soldiers and a scrap of ambition. {***};;
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_2:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3|What do you mean, a liege lord and protector? I won this place by my own hand, I don't need anyone else!{***};;
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_3:siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4|Of course you don't, my {lord/lady}. However, no lord in the land will recognize your claim to the castle unless it is verified by royal decree. They would call {s1} an outlaw stronghold and take it from you at the earliest opportunity. Surely not even you could stand against a whole army.{***};;
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_list_options_4:siege_won_seneschal_6|Hmm. I'll give it some thought.{***};;
dlga_siege_won_seneschal_6:close_window|I am very pleased to hear it, my {lord/lady}. I am only trying to serve you to the best of my ability. Now, if at any time you find you have further need of me, I will be in the great hall arranging a smooth handover of the castle to your forces. {***};;

dlga_seneschal_intro_1b:seneschal_talk|Ah, a Seneschal's duties are many, good {sire/woman}.

dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison:close_window|Of course, {ser/madam}. Go in.{***};;
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison:prison_guard_visit_prison_2|You need to get permission from the lord to talk to prisoners.{***};;
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison:prison_guard_visit_prison_nobody|There is nobody inside, therefore you can freely go inside and look around.{***};;
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_nobody:close_window|All right then. I'll take a look at the prison.{***};;
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_nobody:close_window.1|I have more important business to do.{***};;
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_2:close_window|All right then. I'll try that.{***};;
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_2:prison_guard_visit_prison_3|Come on now. I thought you were the boss here.{***};;
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_3:prison_guard_visit_prison_4|He-heh. You got that right. Still, I can't let you into the prison.{***};;
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_4:close_window|All right then. I'll leave now.{***};;
dlga_prison_guard_visit_prison_4:prison_guard_visit_prison_5|I found a purse containing 100 Silver Stags a few paces away. I reckon it belongs to you.{***};;

dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested|{s9}{***};;
dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window|I think that is a wise move. Good luck to you.{***};;
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.1|Your relations with {s4} are not all that they could be. As {reg4?she:he} is my {s11}, I can mediate to attempt to mend your quarrel. Perhaps the best way for me to do this would be to send {reg4?her:him} a gift -- a fur-trimmed fine cloth robe, perhaps. If you can provide me with a bolt of velvet and a length of furs, I can have one made and sent to {reg4?her:him.}{***};;
dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window.1|Splendid. I shall await the materials.{***};;
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.2|As you may realize, {s4} has many enemies among the lords of the {s5}. In particular, they feel that {reg4?she:he} is {s7}, and worry that {reg4?she:he} will {s8}. Were you to denounce {s4} to {reg4?her:his} face, you may reap much popularity -- although, of course, you would make an enemy of {reg4?her:him}, and risk being challenged to a duel.{***};;
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.3|As you may realize, many of us in the peerage of the {s5} consider {s4} to be {s7}, and a liability to our cause. We worry that {reg4?she:he} will {s8}. People know my views on {s4} already, but if you were to denounce {reg4?her:him} to {reg4?her:his} face, you would further erode his standing -- and discourage our liege from entrusting {reg4?her:him} with any more power or responsibility. Of course, you would make an enemy of {reg4?her:him}, and risk being challenged to a duel.{s9}{***};;
dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window.2|We appreciate what you are doing. I find such intrigues distasteful, but it is all for the good of the {s5}.{***};;
dlga_political_quest_follow_on:close_window.3|Very well. It is always risky to involve yourself in intrigues of this sort, but in this case, I think you will benefit.{***};;
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.4|You and I have a common interest in seeking to curtail the rise of {s4}. I feel that {reg4?she:he} is {s7}, and worry that {reg4?she:he} will {s8}. Were you to tell our liege {s9} your opinion of {s4}, it might discourage {s9} from granting {s4} any further powers or responsibilities, at least for a while, and I would be much obliged to you.{***};;
dlga_combined_political_quests:political_quest_suggested.5|I cannot think of anything right now, but we will have some items of mutual interest in the future.{***};;
dlga_political_quest_suggested:political_quest_follow_on|I like that idea.{***};;
dlga_political_quest_suggested:combined_political_quests|Hmm.. Maybe you can think of something else?{***};;

dlga_local_merchant_mercy:local_merchant_mercy_yes|I'll let you live, if you promise me...{***};;
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes:local_merchant_mercy_yes_2|Of course, I promise, I'll do anything. Just spare my life... {***};;
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_2:local_merchant_mercy_yes_3|You are going to forget about {s2}'s debt to you. And you will sign a paper stating that he owes you nothing.{***};;
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_3:local_merchant_mercy_yes_4|Yes, of course. I'll do as you say.{***};;
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_4:local_merchant_mercy_yes_5|And if my lord hears so much of a hint of a complaint about this issue, then I'll come back for you, and it won't matter how much you scream for mercy then. Do you understand me?{***};;
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_5:local_merchant_mercy_yes_6|Yes {ser/madam}. Don't worry. I won't make any complaint.{***};;
dlga_local_merchant_mercy_yes_6:close_window|Good. Go now, before I change my mind.{***};;
dlga_start:fugitive_1|What do you want?{***};;
dlga_fugitive_1:fugitive_2|I am looking for a murderer by the name of {s4}. You fit his description.{***};;
dlga_fugitive_1:close_window|Nothing. Sorry to trouble you.{***};;
dlga_fugitive_2:fugitive_3|I don't understand, {ser/madam}. I never killed anyone. I think you've got the wrong man.{***};;
dlga_fugitive_3:fugitive_4|Then drop your sword. If you are innocent, you have nothing to fear. We'll go now and talk to your neighbours, and if they verify your story, I'll go on my way.{***};;
dlga_fugitive_4:fugitive_5|I'm not going anywhere, friend. You're going to have to fight for your silver, today.{***};;
dlga_fugitive_5:fugitive_fight_start|No problem. I really just need your head, anyway.{***};;
dlga_fugitive_5:fugitive_fight_start.1|I come not for money, but to execute the law!{***};;
dlga_fugitive_5:fugitive_fight_start.2|Alas, that you cannot be made to see reason.{***};;

dlga_bounty_3:bounty_4|I can assure you I....{***};;

dlga_sacrificed_messenger_1:sacrificed_messenger_2|Take this letter to {s1} and give it to {s2}.{***};;

dlga_sacrificed_messenger_3:close_window|Good. I will not forget your service. You will be rewarded when you return.{***};;
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_3:sacrificed_messenger_cancel|Arggh! I can't do this. I can't send you to your own death!{***};;
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_cancel:sacrificed_messenger_cancel_2|What do you mean {ser/madam}{***};;
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_cancel_2:sacrificed_messenger_cancel_3|There's a trap set up for you in the town. {s3} ordered me to sacrifice one of my chosen warriors to fool the enemy, but he will just need to find another way.{***};;
dlga_sacrificed_messenger_cancel_3:close_window|Thank you, {ser/madam}. I will follow you to the gates of hell. But this would not be a good death.{***};;

dlga_tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_reward_reject:tavernkeeper_pretalk|You are a {s25} for whom justice is its own reward, eh? As you wish it, {playername}, as you wish it. An honourable sentiment, to be true.{***};;
dlga_tavernkeeper_hunt_down_fugitive_fail:tavernkeeper_pretalk|It is a sad day when that {s44} manages to avoid the hand of justice yet again. I thought you would be able to do this, {playername}. Clearly I was wrong.{***};;
dlga_tavernkeeper_request_mission_ask:tavernkeeper_tell_mission|So you reckon yourself a bounty hunter, eh?{***};;
dlga_tavernkeeper_tell_mission:tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_told|I have something you could help with, an issue with the lawless villain known as {s4}.  He supposedly murdered someone, or stole something, or....whatever, and have been on the run from his judgement ever since. There is a bounty of 300 silver stags on his head. Associates of the murderer who, while he issue him no ill will...reckon that this outlaw may have taken refuge with his kinsmen at {s3}.

dlga_tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_accepted:close_window|That's excellent, {playername}. His associates will be so grateful to have him....found. And of course the bounty on his head will be yours if you can get...err find him. Well, good hunting to you.{***};;
dlga_tavernkeeper_mission_hunt_down_fugitive_rejected:tavernkeeper_pretalk|As you wish, {playername}.I suppose there are plenty of bounty hunters around to get the job done . . .{***};;
dlga_measter_menu:tavernkeeper_messenger_system1|Do you have any ravens? I need to send a message.{***};;
dlga_tavernkeeper_messenger_system1:tavernkeeper_messenger_system2|Of course. Who do you want to sent it to? I've heard the following are nearby:{***};;
dlga_tavernkeeper_messenger_system2:measter_menu|No, none of those. Later, perhaps.{***};;
dlga_tavernkeeper_messenger_system3:tavernkeeper_messenger_system4|Very well. What is the message?{***};;
dlga_tavernkeeper_messenger_system4:close_window|It is this...{***};;
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:tavernkeeper_buy_drinks|I'd like to buy every man who comes in here tonight a jar of your best mead.{***};;
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks:tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_2|Of course, {my lord/my lady}. I reckon {reg5} silver stags should be enough for that. What should I tell the lads?{***};;
dlga_tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_2:tavernkeeper_buy_drinks_end|Let everyone know of the generosity of {playername} to the people of {s10}.{***};;

dlga_tavernkeeper_herrero:tavernkeeper_herrero2|Hmm... Well, I do know of one such place where a Valyrian weapon could be reforged. But you must pay me 100 silver stags for more information.{***};;
dlga_tavernkeeper_herrero2:tavernkeeper_herrero3|Sure. Talk!{***};;
dlga_tavernkeeper_herrero2:close_window|I think I will take my chances without your greed thanks. Farewell!{***};;
dlga_tavernkeeper_herrero3:tavernkeeper_herrero4|You must travel to Qohor in Essos, speak to the weaponsmith there. He may be able to help you.{***};;

dlga_tavernkeeper_job_search:tavernkeeper_job_result|Let me think some more...{***};;
dlga_tavernkeeper_job_result:tavernkeeper_job_search|I have heard that {s7} {s9}{s10} You may want to speak with {reg4?her:him}.{***};;
dlga_tavernkeeper_job_result:tavernkeeper_job_result_2|There may be other work, of course -- lords and guild masters often have other tasks which we don't hear about. Also, the villages around here frequently need help, although they'd be more likely to pay you with a wedge of cheese and goodwill than with cold hard silver stags.{***};;
dlga_tavernkeeper_job_result_2:close_window|I'll keep my ears open for other opportunities. You may want to ask again from time to time.{***};;
dlga_tavernkeeper_talk:close_window|I guess I should leave now.{***};;

dlga_wandering_crows_intro_2:wandering_crows_talk1|The Nights Watch will be thankful for it.   Plus you get to sleep well without fear of Free Folk knocking down your door{***};;
dlga_wandering_crows_talk1:wandering_crows_pretalk|OK, ill think about it.{***};;
dlga_start:wandering_crows_talk|Maybe now you have some prisoners for me to take back to the wall?{***};;
dlga_wandering_crows_pretalk:wandering_crows_talk|You can find us wandering around Westeros, whenever you have some prisoners just let one of us know and well take them off your hands.{***};;
dlga_wandering_crows_talk:wandering_crows_sell_prisoners_all|OK, you can take the prisoners I have.{***};;
dlga_wandering_crows_sell_prisoners_all:wandering_crows_sell_prisoners_all_2|Are you sure?{***};;

dlga_wandering_crows_sell_prisoners_2:close_window|Any more scum you find be sure to think of The Watch where these men would be useful.{***};;
dlga_wandering_crows_talk:close_window|Not this time.{***};;
dlga_start:ransom_broker_intro|Greetings to you, {ser/madam}. You look like someone who should get to know me.{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_intro:ransom_broker_intro_2|Why is that?{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_intro_2:ransom_broker_info_talk|I broker ransoms for the poor wretches who are captured in these endless wars. Normally I travel between the salt mines and the slave markets in Essos, on commission from those whose relatives have gone missing. But if I'm out on my errands of mercy, and I come across a fellow dragging around a captive or two, well, there's no harm in a little speculative investment, is there? And you look like the type who might have a prisoner to sell.{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_families|What if their families can't pay?{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_families:ransom_broker_info_talk|Oh, then I spin them a few heart-warming tales of life on the galleys. You'd be surprised what sorts of treasures a peasant can dig out of his auroch shed or wheedle out of his cousins, assuming he's got the proper motivation! And if in the end they cannot come up with the silver, then there are always slave merchants around Essos who are looking for slaves, or even the watch.{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_prices|What can I get for a prisoner?{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_prices:ransom_broker_info_talk|It varies. I fancy that I have a fine eye for assessing a ransom. There are a dozen little things about a man that will tell you whether he goes to bed hungry, or dines each night on soft dumplings and goose. The real money of course is in the gentry, and if you ever want to do my job you'll want to learn about every landowning family in Westeros and Essos, their estates, their heraldry, their offspring both lawful and bastard, and, of course, their credit with the merchants.{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_ransom_me|Would you be able to ransom me if I were taken?{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_me:ransom_broker_info_talk|Of course, yes I can. There's not many who can say that! So always be sure to keep a pot of silver stags buried somewhere, and a loyal servant who can find it in a hurry.{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_info_talk:ransom_broker_pretalk|That's all I need to know. Thank you.{***};;
dlga_start:ransom_broker_talk|Greetings. If you have any prisoners, I will be happy to buy them from you.{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_pretalk:ransom_broker_talk|Anyway, if you have any prisoners, I will be happy to buy them from you.{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners|Then you'd better bring your purse. I have got prisoners to sell.{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_all|I want to sell all prisoners I brought to you.{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_all:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_all_2|Are you sure?{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_all_2:ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_2|I am sure.{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_all_2:ransom_broker_pretalk|Let me think about it.{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:ransom_broker_intro_2|Tell me about what you do again.{***};;

dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_companion_name_sum:ransom_broker_ransom_companion_verify|Let me check my ledger, here... Yes. Your friend is being held in the dungeon at {s7}. How interesting! I remember hearing that the rats down there are unusually large -- like mastiffs, they say... Now... For the very reasonable sum of {reg5} silver stags, which includes both the ransom and my commission and expenses, we can arrange it so that {s5} can once again enjoy {reg4?her:his} freedom. What do you say?{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_companion_verify:ransom_broker_ransom_companion_accept|Here's your money.{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_companion_verify:ransom_broker_ransom_companion_refuse|I can't afford that right now.{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_companion_accept:ransom_broker_talk|Splendid! In a few days, I would think, you should find {s5} riding to rejoin you, blinking in the sunlight and no doubt very grateful! Is there any other way in which I can help you?{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_ransom_companion_refuse:ransom_broker_talk|Of course, of course... Never mind what they say about the rats, by the way -- I've never actually seen one myself, on account of the pitch-black darkness. Anyway, I'm sure that {s5} will understand why it's important for you to control expenditures. Now... Was there anything else?{***};;
dlga_ransom_broker_talk:close_window|Not this time.{***};;

dlga_ransom_broker_sell_prisoners_2:close_window|I will be staying here for a few days. Let me know if you need my services.{***};;
dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk|Greetings, friend. You look like the kind of {man/person} who'd do well to know me. I travel a lot all across Westeros and Essos and keep an open ear. I can provide you information that you might find useful. For a meagre price of course.{***};;
dlga_start:tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks|Greetings, {playername}. I saw your companion {s10} at a tavern in {s11} some days ago. I thought you might like to know.{***};;
dlga_tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks:tavern_traveler_pretalk|Thanks. I'll go and find {reg3?her:him} there.{***};;
dlga_tavern_traveler_lost_companion_thanks:tavern_traveler_pretalk.1|Thanks, but I don't really care.{***};;
dlga_start:tavern_traveler_talk.1|Greetings, {playername}.{***};;
dlga_tavern_traveler_pretalk:tavern_traveler_talk|Yes?{***};;
dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms|What can you tell me about this land?{***};;
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2|Westeros and Essos are divided into rival kingdoms, which can neither manage to live in peace with their neighbours, nor completely eliminate them. As a result, there's seldom a break to the bitter wars which plague this land and drain its life blood. Well, at least this must be a good place to be for an adventurer such as yourself. With some luck and skill, you can make a name for yourself here, amass a fortune perhaps, or gain great power. Opportunities are endless and so are the rewards, if you are willing to risk your life for them.{***};;
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3|Tell me more about these opportunities.{***};;
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_2:close_window|Thank you. That was all I needed to know{***};;
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|Well, you probably know everything I could tell you already. You seem to be doing pretty well.{***};;
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_3:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4a|The kingdoms will pay good money for mercenaries if they are engaged in a war. If you have done a bit of fighting, speaking with one of their lords will probably result in being offered a mercenary contract. However the real rewards come if you can manage to become a vassal to a king. A vassal can own villages, castles and towns and get rich with the taxes and revenues of these estates. Normally, only nobles of the realm own land in this way, but in time of war, a king will not hesitate to accept someone who distinguishes {himself/herself} on the battlefield as a vassal, and grant {him/her} the right to own land.{***};;
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4a:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4|It is not unheard-of for adventurers to renounce allegiance to a king altogether, declare themselves kings, and claim land in their own name. This is a difficult path, however, as the great nobles of the land, with their long ancestries, are not likely to accept such upstarts as their monarch. Such rulers would need to be very careful in establishing their right to rule, or they would be set upon from all sides.{***};;
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_4:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5|It might be easier for an adventurer like yourself to pledge support to an existing king's rival.  There are many such usurpers in Westeros or even Essos -- those who are born to the right family, who go around and stir up trouble saying they have a better claim to the throne than the current king. If those claim holders could find supporters, they could easily start civil wars and perhaps even replace the king one day.{***};;
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6|Interesting. Where can I find these claim holders?{***};;
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_5:close_window|I guess I heard enough already. Thank you.{***};;
dlga_tavern_traveler_tell_kingdoms_6:tavern_traveler_pretalk|A claim holder's life would be in danger in his own country of course. Therefore, they usually stay at rival courts, raising support and hoping to find someone willing to champion their cause. I usually hear news about some of them, and may be able to tell you their location with some precision. But of course, I would ask for a little something for such a service.{***};;
dlga_tavern_traveler_talk:tavern_traveler_pretender_location|I want to know the location of a claimant.{***};;

dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_player_advice_woo|Having met a lady, how would the suitor woo her?{***};;
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_nobles|Tell me about marriage and love among the nobility of Westeros and Essos.{***};;
dlga_minstrel_nobles:minstrel_nobles_2|Nobles are an odd lot. In Westeros, a daughter is a political asset, to be given away to a lord with whom her father wishes to make an alliance.{***};;
dlga_minstrel_nobles_2:minstrel_nobles_3|Fathers differ, of course. Some nobles will let their daughters choose a husband who pleases them. Others, however, feel that to allow their daughters any choice at all would be to diminish their own authority, and insist on imposing a groom whether she likes it or not.{***};;
dlga_minstrel_nobles_3:minstrel_prequestions|But the majority will steer a middle course -- they will want to make the final decision about a groom, but will weigh their daughters preferences heavily. Among other factors, a happy marriage is more likely to produce heirs. So, there is a place for courtship, and for the use of skill and passion to win a lady's heart.{***};;
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_daughter_father|What if a lady and her father disagree about a suitor?{***};;
dlga_minstrel_daughter_father:minstrel_daughter_father_2|It happens sometimes that a bride elopes. This is a major blow to the fathers prestige, leading to lasting enmities. Indeed, it is possible that a war may be fought over a woman. Now, that is a fine topic for a song.{***};;
dlga_minstrel_daughter_father_2:minstrel_prequestions|In the end, however, most brides will submit to their parents choice. A noblewoman's family is everything to her, and few are brave enough to risk its disapproval for the sake of man she barely knows. She may pine for her lover, but still accept the groom -- and without tragic love, what would we have to sing about?{***};;
dlga_minstrel_player_role:minstrel_player_role_2|Of course! lords make a great deal of lineage, but in the end, lands and money speak louder than one's ancestors. Even if you are a foreigner, or not from the nobility, if you are coming up in the world, then many parents will consider you a fine catch.{***};;
dlga_minstrel_player_role_2:minstrel_player_role_3|You will have to compete with many other lords of your realm, however, who will have an advantage -- they have known these ladies from childhood, and will have been sized up as grooms by carefully discerning mothers and aunts. Some ladies may be fascinated by the stranger, yet opt for the familiar.{***};;
dlga_minstrel_player_role_3:minstrel_prequestions|So know this -- you may have your heart broken. But to enter the arena of love fearing heartbreak is like entering the battlefield fearing the enemy's arrows. Be brave, and shrug off the sting of rejection, and victory may yet be yours.{***};;
dlga_minstrel_player_role:minstrel_female_player_3|Lady -- I will speak bluntly. Most of the lords of this land are looking for a demure maiden, whose skins as fair as snow -- and your skin is burnt brown by the sun. They want a maiden whose voice is soft as bells -- and your voice is hoarse from commanding men in battle. Also, although the lords of Westeros and Essos appreciate poems about love, most also want heirs, and few women can ride and fight while with child.{***};;
dlga_minstrel_female_player_3:minstrel_prequestions|However, not all lords will be so conventionally minded. We poets sing of shield maidens and of huntresses, of women who forged their own path without having sacrificed the chance for love. I would not tell you that it would be easy for you to find a devoted husband who will accept your ways, but I would not say that it is impossible.{***};;
dlga_minstrel_courtship_questions_2:minstrel_spouse_benefits|What advantage is there in seeking a {wife/husband}?{***};;
dlga_minstrel_spouse_benefits:minstrel_wife_benefits_2|Ah! You are quite the romantic, I see! Well, aside from the obvious benefits of love, companionship and other, em, domestic matters, to marry among the nobility brings great assets. You may forge a strong alliance with the bride's family, and a wife may also assist you in manipulating the politics of the realm to your advantage.{***};;
dlga_minstrel_wife_benefits_2:minstrel_prequestions|What's more, most of the great families of Westeros and Essos have at some point intermarried with royalty, which would boost your own claim to rule -- should you ever choose to assert it...{***};;
dlga_minstrel_spouse_benefits:minstrel_wife_benefits_2.1|Ah! You are quite the romantic, I see! Well, aside from the obvious benefits of love, companionship and other, em, domestic matters, to marry among the nobility brings great assets. You may have access to the grooms castles and properties, and be able to work with him to advance both of your standings in the realm.{***};;
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_meet:minstrel_player_advice_meet_2|Every so often, a king or great lord of Westeros and Essos will hold a feast. In towns they will often be accompanied by tournaments, and in castles they should be accompanied by hunts, which, unfortunately, do not occur yet. The feasts provide a chance for the lords to repair some of the rivalries that may undermine the strength of the realm. They also provide an opportunity for families to show off their eligible daughters, and ladies will often be allowed to mingle unsupervised with the guests.{***};;
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_meet_2:minstrel_prequestions|If you have the opportunity, you may attempt to pay the lady a compliment. This indicates to her that you are a potential suitor, and she will usually know if she wishes you to continue your suit. Incidentally, if you come to her fresh from having distinguished yourself in the tournament or in the hunt, then you may make a stronger first impression than otherwise.{***};;
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo:minstrel_player_advice_woo_2|To woo a lady takes a certain amount of time and patience, and several meetings spaced over a period of months. A lady who is interested in you will often find ways of letting you know if she wishes you to come visit her. Alternately, you may simply go and ask her father or brother for permission. If you do not have permission from her guardian, it may be possible to arrange an assignation through other means.{***};;
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_2:minstrel_player_advice_woo_3|Having arranged an assignment, you may then attempt to charm her and win her favour. Perhaps one of the most difficult aspects of this is finding a topic of conversation. Most noblewomen lead a cloistered life, at least until they are married, and thus will have little to say that will interest you. On other hand, she will soon tire of hearing of your own deeds in the outside world.{***};;
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_3:minstrel_player_advice_woo_4|One time-tested mode of courtship is simply to recite a popular poem or tale, and discuss it. This way, you are both on an equal footing, and neither will have an advantage in knowledge or experience. Of course, different ladies will have different tastes in poetry and story.{***};;
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_4:minstrel_player_advice_woo_5|At some point, you will be able to discuss directly the issue of marriage. She will then let you know if you measure up to what she wants in a husband. Some ladies will coolly assess who is the most prestigious of her suitors, others will be guided by their passions. Some will look to your companions, to see whether you are the kind of husband who will treat her as an equal, while others will follow the lead of their fathers.{***};;
dlga_minstrel_player_advice_woo_5:minstrel_prequestions|At any rate, it is a challenging business -- and do not forget, you may find that your suit prospers with a lady, only to have it falter on a father's political ambitions. So you must ask yourself: are you willing to risk disappointment and heartbreak? Alternately, are you willing to throw away your standing in society, to make enemies of allies, in pursuit of a forbidden love? Because if you are, then perhaps some day we will write poems about you.{***};;

dlga_quastuosa_serve3a:quastuosa_pretalk1|Well, I suppose my men have earned it. This time.{***};;
dlga_quastuosa_serve3b:quastuosa_pretalk|Well, I suppose my men have earned it. This time.{***};;

dlga_quastuosa_serve4a:close_window|No thanks. Why help you steal from me?{***};;
dlga_quastuosa_serve5a:quastuosa_pretalk1|(Time passes, and you forget the rigours and fatigue from the journey that lingered upon your body and soul. For a few hours, your armour and sword, the fear of dying in any skirmish, the punishment of the rain and wind, and the dust of the roads are relegated to a small piece of happiness. Finally, it ends swiftly as your friend quietly leaves your room.){***};;

dlga_spy_presentacion:mercenary_tavern_talk|Me? - he leans his head towards your ear and whispers -. We are very useful.

dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:leader_presentacion|Mm, What can you offer me?{***};;
dlga_leader_presentacion:mercenary_tavern_talk|Me? I can lead men. That means you can give me some of your troops and I will lead them in my own party, on your behalf, and according to your orders. I can patrol areas for you, attack enemies or secure a position, among other things.{***};;
dlga_mercenary_tavern_talk:close_window|Sorry. I don't need any other men right now.{***};;
dlga_start:trainer_intro_1|Good day to you {lad/lass}. You look like another adventurer who has come to try {his/her} chance in these lands. Well, trust my word, you won't be able to survive long here unless you know how to fight yourself out of a tight spot.{***};;
dlga_trainer_intro_1:trainer_intro_2|Thank you for your advice. This place looks like a training field. Maybe I can learn about fighting here?{***};;
dlga_trainer_intro_2:trainer_intro_3|Indeed you can. I am a veteran soldier... fought a good deal in the wars in my time. But these days, I train young novices in this area. I can find you some opponents to practice with if you like. Or if you have any questions about the theory of combat, feel free to ask.{***};;
dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4a|Yes, I do have a few questions.{***};;
dlga_trainer_intro_3:trainer_intro_4b|Actually, I can move on to practice.{***};;
dlga_trainer_intro_4a:trainer_talk_combat|Well, ask anything you like.{***};;
dlga_trainer_intro_4b:trainer_practice_1|Good. It's good to find someone eager for practice. Let's see what you will do.{***};;
dlga_start:trainer_practice_1|That was a good fight. {***};;
dlga_start:trainer_practice_1.1|Ha! Looks like you've developed a bit of a limp there. Don't worry, even losses have their value, provided you learn from them. Shake the stars out of your eyes and get back in there. There's no other way to win.{***};;
dlga_start:trainer_talk|Good day. Ready for some training today?{***};;
dlga_trainer_pretalk:trainer_talk|Ah, are you ready for some training?{***};;
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_practice_1|I am ready for some practice.{***};;
dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_combat_begin|First, tell me something about combat...{***};;

dlga_trainer_talk:trainer_training_lair0_tr|I'd like to discuss training options.{***};;
dlga_trainer_training_lair0_tr:trainer_training_lair0|I can take your recruits and turn them into warriors.{***};;

dlga_trainer_training_lair2:trainer_training_lair3a|Do you want me to use an alternative promotion when available?{***};;
dlga_trainer_training_lair3a:trainer_training_lair3|Yes.{***};;
dlga_trainer_training_lair3a:trainer_training_lair3.1|No.{***};;
dlga_trainer_training_lair3:trainer_talk|Alright, I will train the recruits in {s11}. Place the troops you want me to train at the bottom of the garrison list.{***};;
dlga_trainer_training_lair4_stop:trainer_pretalk|As you wish, my {reg59?lady:lord}.{***};;
dlga_trainer_talk:close_window|I need to leave now. Farewell.{***};;
dlga_trainer_combat_begin:trainer_talk_combat|What do you want to know?{***};;
dlga_trainer_combat_pretalk:trainer_talk_combat|What else do you want to know?{***};;
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_defense|Tell me about defending myself.{***};;
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_attack|Tell me about attacking with weapons.{***};;
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_explain_horseback|Tell me about fighting on horseback.{***};;
dlga_trainer_talk_combat:trainer_pretalk|I guess I know all the theory I need. Let's talk about something else.{***};;
dlga_trainer_explain_defense:trainer_explain_defense_2|Good question. The first thing you should know as a fighter is how to defend yourself. Keeping yourself out of harm's way is the first rule of combat, and it is much more important than giving harm to others. Everybody can swing a sword around and hope to cut some flesh, but only those fighters that are experts at defence live to tell of it.{***};;
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_2:trainer_explain_defense_3|Now. Defending yourself is easiest if you are equipped with a shield. Just block with your shield. [Hold down the right mouse button to defend yourself with the shield.] In this state, you will be able to deflect all attacks that come from your front. However, you will still be open to strikes from your sides or your back.{***};;
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_3:trainer_explain_defense_4|What if I don't have a shield?{***};;
dlga_trainer_explain_defense_4:trainer_combat_pretalk|Then you will have to use your weapon to block your opponent. This is a bit more difficult than defending with a shield. Defending with a weapon, you can block against only ONE attack direction. That is, you block against either overhead swings, side swings or thrusts. Therefore you must watch your opponent carefully and start to block AFTER he starts his attack. In this way you will be able to block against the direction of his current attack. If you start to block BEFORE he makes his move, he may just attack in another direction than the one you are blocking against and score a hit.{***};;
dlga_trainer_explain_attack:trainer_explain_attack_2|Good question. Attacking is the best defence, they say. A tactic many fighters find useful is taking an offensive stance and readying your weapon for attack, waiting for the right moment for swinging it. [You can ready your weapon for attack by pressing and holding down the left mouse button.]{***};;
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_2:trainer_explain_attack_3|That sounds useful.{***};;
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_3:trainer_explain_attack_4|It is a good tactic, but remember that, your opponent may see that and take a defensive stance against the direction you are swinging your weapon. If that happens, you must break your attack and quickly attack from another direction [You may cancel your current attack by quickly tapping the right mouse button].{***};;
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_4:trainer_explain_attack_5|If my opponent is defending against the direction I am attacking from, I will break and use another direction.{***};;
dlga_trainer_explain_attack_5:trainer_combat_pretalk|Yes, selecting the direction you swing your weapon is a crucial skill. There are four main directions you may use: right swing, left swing, overhead swing and thrust. You must use each one wisely. [to control your swing direction with default controls, move your mouse in the direction you want to swing from as you press the left mouse button].{***};;
dlga_trainer_explain_horseback:trainer_combat_pretalk|Very good question. A horse may be a warrior's most powerful weapon in combat. It gives you speed, height, power and initiative. A lot of deadly weapons will become even deadlier on horseback. However you must pay particular attention to horse-mounted enemies couching their lances, as they may take down any opponent in one hit. [To use the couched lance yourself, wield a lance or similar weapon, and speed up your horse without pressing attack or defence buttons. after you reach a speed, you'll lower your lance. Then try to target your enemies by manoeuvring your horse.]{***};;
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1|I train novices in four stages, each tougher than the one before. To finish a stage and advance to the next one, you have to win three fights in a row.{***};;
dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_are_you_ready|You have passed all stages of training. But if you want you can still practice. Are you ready?{***};;
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.1|Way to go {lad/lass}. With this victory, you have advanced to the next training level. From now on your opponents will be regular fighters, not the riff-raff off the street, so be on your toes.{***};;
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.2|Way to go {lad/lass}. Welcome to the third training level. From now on your opponents will be veteran fighters; soldiers and arena regulars and the like. These guys know some dirty tricks, so keep your defence up.{***};
dlga_trainer_practice_1:trainer_practice_1.3|You've got the heart of a champion, {lad/lass}, and the sword arm to match. From now on your opponents will be champion fighters. These are the cream of the crop, the finest warriors I have trained. If you can best three of them in a row, you will join their ranks.{***};;
dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_finish_training|It does my heart good to see such a promising talent. You have passed all tiers of training. You can now tell everyone that you have been trained by the master of the training field.{***};;

dlga_novicemaster_finish_training_2:close_window|I wish you good luck in the tournaments. And, don't forget,  if you want to practice your sword work any time, just come and say the word.{***};;
dlga_trainer_practice_1:novicemaster_are_you_ready.1|Your next opponent will be a {s9}. You need to win {reg8} more fights in a row to advance to the next stage. Are you ready?{***};;

dlga_novicemaster_ready_to_fight:close_window|Here you go then. Good luck.{***};;

dlga_start_craftsman_soon:close_window|Good day, my {lord/lady}. We hope to begin production in about {reg4} days{***};;

dlga_master_craftsman_pretalk:master_craftsman_talk|Very good, my {lord/lady}. Do you require anything else?{***};;
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_accounts|Let's go over the accounts.{***};;

dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk.1|I'd like you to sell goods as they are produced.{***};;
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_pretalk.2|I'd like you to keep all goods in the warehouse until I arrive.{***};;
dlga_master_craftsman_accounts:master_craftsman_pretalk|We currently produce {s3} worth {reg1} silver stags each week, while the quantity of {s4} needed to manufacture it costs {reg2}, and labour and upkeep are {reg3}.{s9} This means that we theoretically make a {s12} of {reg0} silver stags a week, assuming that we have no raw materials in the inventories, and that we sell directly to the market.{***};;
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_production_options|Could you explain my options related to production?{***};;
dlga_master_craftsman_production_options:master_craftsman_production_options_2|Certainly, my {lord/lady}. Most of the time, the most profitable thing for you to do would be to let us buy raw materials and sell the finished goods directly to the market. Because of our long-standing relations with the local merchants, we can usually get a very good price.{***};;
dlga_master_craftsman_production_options_2:master_craftsman_pretalk|However, if you find that you can acquire raw materials cheaper outside {s5}, you may place them in the inventories, and we will use them instead of buying from the market. Likewise, if you feel that you can get a better price for the finished goods elsewhere, then you may ask us to deposit what we produce in our warehouses for you to take.{***};;
dlga_master_craftsman_talk:master_craftsman_auction_price|It will no longer be possible for me to continue operating this enterprise.{***};;
dlga_master_craftsman_auction_price:master_craftsman_auction_decide|A pity, my {lord/lady}. If we sell the land and the equipment, and liquidate the inventories, I estimate that we can get {reg4} silver stags.{***};;
dlga_master_craftsman_auction_decide:master_craftsman_liquidation|That sounds reasonable. Please proceed with the sale.{***};;
dlga_master_craftsman_auction_decide:master_craftsman_pretalk|Hmm. Let's hold off on that.{***};;

dlga_druid_talk:druid_ayuda|I am still true to the Old Celtic Gods' ways. And I'm glad to see a druid is still among us.{***};;
dlga_druid_talk:druid_ayuda.1|I wish to be taught about the old Celtic gods so that I might honour them (Conversion to Celtic Cult).{***};;
dlga_druid_talk:close_window|I have no need for a man of any god at this time.{***};;
dlga_druid_ayuda:druid_ayu|I want to tell you about our gods, Who came largely from two families: the Children of Don and the Children of Llyr. Don was a goddess of the sky, and Llyr was a god of the sea. Don the big mother, among her children were the god Gwydion and the goddess Arianrod.Gwydion was a god druid, a 'master of illusion and fantasy.' He was a friend and helper of mankind, and a constant fighter against the powers of the underworld, the realm of Annwn.{***};;
dlga_druid_ayu:druid_ayuda2|Arianrod, called the 'Silver Circle', bore two sons, Dylan and Lleu. Dylan had a great affinity for the sea, and swam as well as the best fish in the ocean. It is said that the waves of Britannia wept for Dylan at his death. Arianrod had poor bonds with her other son Lleu, and his care was left largely to Gwydion. Math, the brother of the goddess Don, was a master of magic and Gwydion's teacher of spells.Do you Want to make a sacrifice to the old gods?. But I warn you they are fickle.{***};;
dlga_druid_ayuda2:druid_sins|I will donate 300 coins for this temple.{***};;

We are near Dyfed Kingdom, a territory connected with Annwn, the Underworld.Here, we are close to all the gods and goddesses, because this is the time of their fall. The gods of Annwn are now the most powerful. I am a follower of Bran, god of the underworld, whose eminence is most often associated with his 'Wonderful Head.'.Bran is also a patron on bards, minstrels, and musicians.

dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed:mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2|Aye, my scouts saw the whole thing. That should make anyone else think twice before turning outlaw! The bounty is 40 silver stags for every band, so that makes {reg1} in total. Here is your money, as promised.{***};;
dlga_mayor_looters_quest_destroyed_2:close_window|And that's not the only good news! Thanks to you, the bandits have ceased to be a threat. We've not had a single attack reported for some time now.

dlga_mayor_begin:close_window|Good to see you again {playername}. I have heard that you have delivered the cattle successfully. I will tell the merchants how reliable you are. And here is your pay, {reg8} silver stags.{***};;

dlga_move_cattle_herd_failed_2:merchant_ask_for_debts|Well, it was your responsibility to deliver that herd safely, no matter what. You should know that the owner of the herd demanded to be compensated for his loss, and I had to pay him 1000 silver stags. So you now owe me that money.{***};;
dlga_mayor_begin:close_window.1|{playername} -- I am in your debt for bringing back my friend's daughter.  Please take these {reg8} silver stags that I promised you.  My friend wished he could give more but paying that ransom brought him to his knees.{***};;
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk|Well -- it sounds like you were able to track down the bandits, and show them what happens to those who would disrupt the flow of commerce. Here is your reward: {reg5} silver stags. It is well earned, and we are most grateful.{***};;
dlga_mayor_begin:mayor_friendly_pretalk.1|I have heard about your deeds. You have given those bandits the punishment they deserved. You are really as good as they say. Here is your reward: {reg5} silver stags. I would like to give more but those bandits almost brought me to bankruptcy.{***};;
dlga_mayor_begin:merchant_ask_for_debts|According to my accounts, you owe the merchants guild {reg1} silver stags. I'd better collect that now.{***};;
dlga_merchant_ask_for_debts:merchant_debts_paid|Alright. I'll pay my debt to you.{***};;
dlga_merchant_debts_paid:mayor_pretalk|Excellent. I'll let my fellow merchants know that you are clear of any debts.{***};;

dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_last_offered_job|About that job you offered me...{***};;
dlga_mayor_talk:merchant_quest_about_job|About the job you gave me...{***};;
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_political_talk|I have some questions of a political nature.{***};;
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_economy_report_1|How is trade around here?{***};;
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_wealth_comparison_1|How does the wealth of this region compare with the rest of Westeros and Essos?{***};;
dlga_mayor_talk:mayor_investment_possible|I wish to buy land in this town for a productive enterprise{***};;
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk|You already operate a {s4} here. There probably aren't enough skilled tradesmen to start a second enterprise.{***};;
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk.1|{s9}{***};;
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment_advice.1|Of course, {ser/my lady}. You are the lord of this town, and no one is going to stop you.{***};;
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment|Well... Given your relationship with our liege, {s4}, I think that you will not find many here who are brave enough to sell you any land.{***};;
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_pretalk.2|Well... To be honest, I think that we in the guild would like to know you a little better. We can be very particular about outsiders coming in here and buying land.{***};;
dlga_mayor_investment_possible:mayor_investment_advice.2|Very good, {ser/my lady}. We in the guild know and trust you, and I think I could find someone to sell you the land you need.{***};;
dlga_mayor_investment_advice:investment_choose_enterprise|A couple of things to keep in mind -- skilled labourers are always at a premium, so I doubt that you will be able to open up more than one enterprise here. In order to make a profit for yourself, you should choose a commodity which is in relatively short supply, but for which the raw materials are cheap. What sort of enterprise would you like to start?{***};;
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary|A mill and bakery, to make bread from grain{***};;
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.1|A brewery, to make ale from grain{***};;
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.2|A tannery, to make leather from hides{***};;
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.3|A wine press, to make wine from grapes{***};;
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.4|An oil press, to make oil from olives{***};;
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.5|An ironworks, to make tools from iron{***};;
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.6|A weavers and dyeworks, to make fine cloth from wool and dye{***};;
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.7|A weavery, to make wool cloth from wool{***};;
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:investment_summary.8|A weavery, to make linen from flax{***};;
dlga_investment_choose_enterprise:mayor_pretalk|Never mind{***};;
dlga_investment_summary:mayor_investment_confirm|Very good, {ser/madam}. The land and the materials on which you may build your {s3} will cost you {reg7} silver stags. Right now, your {s3} will produce {s4} worth {reg1} silver stags each week, while the {s6} needed to manufacture that batch will be {reg2} and labour and upkeep will be {reg3}.{s9} I should guess that your profit would be {reg0} silver stags a week. This assumes of course that prices remain constant -- which, I can virtually guarantee you, they will not. Do you wish to proceed?{***};;
dlga_mayor_investment_confirm:mayor_investment_purchase|Yes. Here is money for the land.{***};;
dlga_mayor_investment_confirm:mayor_pretalk|No -- that's not economical for me at the moment.{***};;
dlga_mayor_investment_purchase:mayor_pretalk|Very good. Your enterprise should be up and running in about a week. When next you come, and thereafter, you should speak to your {s4} about its operations.{***};;
dlga_mayor_talk:close_window|[Leave]{***};;
dlga_mayor_info_begin:mayor_info_talk|I am the guild master of {s9}. You can say I am the leader of the good people of {s9}. I can help you find a job if you are looking for some honest work.{***};;
dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_info_lord|Who rules this town?{***};;
dlga_mayor_info_lord:mayor_info_talk|Our town's lord and protector is {s10}. {s10} owns the castle and sometimes resides there and collects taxes from the town. However, we regulate ourselves in most of the matters that concern ourselves. As the town's guild master, I have the authority to decide those things.{***};;
dlga_mayor_info_talk:mayor_pretalk|That's all I need to know. Thanks.{***};;
dlga_mayor_political_talk:mayor_political_questions|Politics? Good heaven, the guild has nothing to do with politics. We are loyal servants of {s10}. We merely govern our own affairs, and pass on the townspeople's concerns to our lords and masters, and maybe warn them from time to time against evil advice. Anyway, what did you wish to ask?{***};;
dlga_mayor_prepolitics:mayor_political_questions|Did I mention that we here are all {s9}? Because I can't stress that enough... Anyway... Is there anything else?{***};;
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_war_description_1|What is the cause of all these wars in Westeros and Essos?{***};;
dlga_mayor_war_description_1:mayor_war_description_2|Well, to answer your question generally, each monarch claims to be the rightful heir to the title of Westeros, ruler of all the known world. Some of these claims are based on forgotten dynastic marriages and others are based on obscure promises, while some others are forged through sheer strength of arms. So in theory, any one realm has the right to declare war on any other realm at any time.{***};;
dlga_mayor_war_description_2:mayor_war_description_3|In practice, to make war is exhausting work. It is easy enough to lay waste to the enemy's farmland, but crops will grow back, and it is a far different matter to capture an enemy stronghold and to hold it. So the monarchs of Westeros and Essos will fight a little, sign a truce, fight a little more, and so on and so forth. Often, a monarch will go to war when another realm provokes them. At such times, some bad influences who look to enrich themselves with ransoms and pillage will clamour for retribution, and thus the damage caused by war to a monarch's treasury is less than the damage caused by doing nothing would be to his authority... I'm of course not talking about {s10}, as no one would ever question {reg4?her:his} authority{***};;
dlga_mayor_war_description_3:mayor_war_description_4|I would stress again that us merchants have nothing to do with politics. But if {s10} were to ask for my advice on these matters, as a loyal subject, I would tell {reg4?her:him} that while {reg4?her:his} claim to all of Westeros and Essos is truly just, even the most legitimate claim must be backed by armed men, and armed men want money, and money comes from trade, and war ruins trade, so sometimes the best way to push a claim is not to push it, if you know what I mean...{***};;
dlga_mayor_war_description_4:mayor_prepolitics|You may tell {s10} this if you see {reg4?her:him}. Don't mention my name specifically -- just say 'the people of {s4}' told you this. Our personal opinion, of course, as to what would be in {s10}'s best interests. None of us would ever dream of questioning a monarch's sovereign right to push {reg4?her:his} legitimate claims.{***};;
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_politics_assess|What is {s10}'s policy in regards to the other realms of Westeros and Essos?{***};;
dlga_mayor_politics_assess:mayor_politics_assess_realm|Which realm did you have in mind?{***};;
dlga_mayor_politics_assess_realm:mayor_politics_give_realm_assessment|{s11}{***};;
dlga_mayor_politics_give_realm_assessment:mayor_prepolitics|{s14}{***};;
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_internal_politics|What can you say about the internal politics of the realms?{***};;
dlga_mayor_internal_politics:mayor_internal_politics_2|Well, here in the {s4} we are all united by our love for {s5} and support for {reg4?her:his} legitimate claim to the leadership of all Westeros and Essos. But I have heard some talk of internal bickering in other realms...{***};;
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_2:mayor_internal_politics_3|The lords of a realm often have very different ideas about honour, strategy, and the way a nobleman should behave. In addition, they compete with each other for the ruler's favour, and are constantly weighing up their position -- how they stand, how their friends and family stand, and how their enemies stand.{***};;
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_3:mayor_internal_politics_4|Underlying all the tensions is the possibility that a lord may abandon his liege, and pledge vassalage to another. In theory, each lord has sworn an oath of vassalage, but in practice, a vassal can always find an excuse to absolve himself. The vassal may claim that the liege has failed to hold up his end of the bargain, to protect the vassal and treat him justly. Or, the vassal may claim that his liege is in fact a usurper, and another has a better claim to the kingship.{***};;
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_4:mayor_internal_politics_5|Lieges and vassals still watch each other carefully. If a king believes that his vassal is going to change sides or rebel, he may indict the vassal for treason and seize his properties. Likewise, if a vassal fears that he will be indicted, he may rebel. Usually, whoever makes the first move will be able to control the vassal's fortresses.{***};;
dlga_mayor_internal_politics_5:mayor_prepolitics|Now, men do not trust a vassal who turns coat easily, nor do they trust a king who lightly throws around charges of treason. Those two factors can keep a realm together. But if relations between a vassal and a liege deteriorate far enough, things can become very tense indeed... In other lands, of course. These things could never happen here in the {s4}.{***};;
dlga_mayor_political_questions:mayor_pretalk|That is all. Thank you.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_about_job:merchant_quest_about_job_2|What about it?{***};;

dlga_merchant_quest_taken:mayor_pretalk|Excellent. I am counting on you then. Good luck.{***};;

dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_looters_choice|We've had some fighting near the {s5} lately, with all the chaos that comes with it, and that's led some of our less upstanding locals to try and make their fortune out of looting the shops and farms during the confusion. A lot of valuable goods were taken. I need somebody to teach those bastards a lesson. Sound like your kind of work?{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_looters_brief|Aye, I'll do it.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_choice:merchant_quest_stall|I'm afraid I can't take the job at the moment.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_looters_brief:close_window|Excellent! You'll find the bandits roaming around the countryside, probably trying to rob more good people.

dlga_merchant_quest_requested:merchant_quest_explain_2|Well, there is a very great favour which you could do us... As you may have heard, some {s10}s have come across the border to attack our people. {s5} is under great pressure from some of the more bellicose of his vassals to respond with a declaration of war. Unfortunately, while the great lords of this land grow rich from bloodshed, we of the commons will be caught in the middle, and will suffer.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_explain_2:merchant_quest_brief|We are not saying that {s5} should overlook this aggression -- far from it! But if he charges one of his own lords to respond, then the cycle of provocation will necessarily lead to a full-fledged confrontation. Now, if an outsider were to step in and defeat a {s10} lord in battle, then honour would be done, and it would defuse the clamour for war. If the defeated lord were a known troublemaker -- {s7} -- then the {s10}s might be able to overlook it.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_brief:merchant_quest_retaliate_confirm|We need you to attack and defeat {s7}. This will not be an easy task, and that outsider would damage {his/her} relationship with the {s10}s, but we would be very grateful.

dlga_merchant_quest_retaliate_confirm:merchant_quest_track_bandits_brief|Aye, I can do it.{***};;

dlga_village_elder_ask_fugitive:village_elder_pretalk|Strangers come and go to our village, {ser/madam}. But I doubt you'll run into him at this hour of the night. You would have better luck during the day.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_fugitive:close_window|Strangers come and go to our village, {ser/madam}. If he is hiding here, you will surely find him if you look around.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_active_mission_1|About the task you asked of me...{***};;
dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_request_mission_ask|Do you have any tasks I can help you with?{***};;
dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_trade_begin|I want to buy some supplies. I will pay with stags.{***};;

dlga_village_elder_talk:oim_choose_quests|Perhaps I could offer more aid?{***};;
dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_levy_begin|I need to raise the levy.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_levy_begin:village_elder_levy_1|Very well. We can raise {reg33} people. Do you want to proceed? Please, keep in mind that taking men away from the fields will negatively impact our village.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_levy_1:village_elder_pretalk|Hmm, no, I don't want to do that.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_levy_1:village_elder_levy_2|Yes, please call up all the eligible men. And get your gear, too.{***};;

dlga_village_elder_give_order:village_elder_give_order1|What would you like us to do?{***};;
dlga_village_elder_give_order1:village_elder_follow|Follow me.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_follow:close_window|Of course.{***};;

dlga_village_elder_disband:close_window|Thank you. We'll be happy to go back home.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_talk:village_tax|I would like to set a new tax rate for this village.{***};;
dlga_village_tax:village_tax2|Certainly. What taxes do you want us to pay you?{***};;
dlga_village_tax2:village_tax3|I would like to set a low tax rate.{***};;
dlga_village_tax2:village_tax3.1|I would like to set a high tax rate.{***};;
dlga_village_tax2:village_tax3.2|I would like to set a normal tax rate.{***};;
dlga_village_tax2:village_elder_pretalk|Actually, I changed my mind.{***};;
dlga_village_tax3:village_elder_pretalk|Most certainly. We shall abide by your most gracious order.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_give_order1:close_window|Never mind.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_trade_begin:village_elder_trade_talk|Of course, {ser/madam}. Do you want to buy goods or cattle?{***};;
dlga_village_elder_trade_talk:village_elder_trade|I want to buy food and supplies.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_trade:village_elder_pretalk|We have some food and other supplies in our storehouse. Come have a look.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_trade_talk:village_elder_buy_cattle|I want to buy some cattle.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_get_cattle_gift|I have {reg25} head of cattle that I would like to gift to your village.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_get_cattle_gift:village_elder_pretalk|Yes, definitely. Our people will be extremely grateful for such a generous gift.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_trade_talk:village_elder_pretalk|I changed my mind. I don't need to buy anything.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_ask_enemies|Have you seen any enemies around here recently?{***};;

dlga_village_elder_tell_enemies:village_elder_tell_enemies|{s1} {s2}{***};;
dlga_village_elder_tell_enemies:village_elder_pretalk|No, {ser/madam}. We haven't seen any war parties in this area for some time.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_tell_enemies:village_elder_pretalk.1|Well, I guess that was all.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_ask_set_fire|I need you to set a large fire on the outskirts of this village.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire:close_window|We have already agreed upon this, {ser/my lady}. I will do my best. You can trust me.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire:village_elder_ask_set_fire_1|A fire, {ser/madam}! Fires are dangerous! Why would you want such a thing?{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire:village_elder_ask_set_fire_5|I believe that we have already discussed this issue, {ser/my lady}.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire:village_elder_ask_set_fire_5.1|We talked about this {ser/madam} before and your previous offers were low compared to risk you want me to take.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_1:village_elder_ask_set_fire_2|I have my reasons, and you will have yours -- a purse of stags. Will you do it, or not?{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_1:village_elder_ask_set_fire_explain_plan|Given the risk you are taking, you are entitled to know my plan.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_explain_plan:village_elder_ask_set_fire_2|I wish to rescue a prisoner from {s4}. When you light the fire, the guards in {s4} will see the smoke, and some of them will rush outside to see what is going on. {***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_2:village_elder_ask_set_fire_9|As you wish, {ser/my lady}. You have been a good friend to this village, and, even though there is a risk, we should be glad to return the favour. When do you want this fire to start?{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_2:close_window|I'm sorry, {ser/my lady}. You will forgive me for saying this, but we don't exactly have good reason to trust you. This is too dangerous.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_2:village_elder_ask_set_fire_3|As you say, {ser/my lady}. But in doing this, we are taking a very great risk. What's in it for us?{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_3:village_elder_ask_set_fire_4|I can give you 100 silver stags.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_3:village_elder_ask_set_fire_6|I can give you 200 silver stags.{***};;

dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_3:close_window|Never mind.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_4:village_elder_talk|This is madness. I cannot take such a risk.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_5:village_elder_ask_set_fire_7|Then let's increase your reward to 200 silver stags.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_5:village_elder_ask_set_fire_6|Then let's increase your reward to 300 silver stags.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_5:village_elder_ask_set_fire_6.1|Then let's increase your reward to 300 silver stags. This is my last offer.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_5:close_window|Never mind.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_6:village_elder_ask_set_fire_9|Very well. You are asking me to take a very great risk, but I will do it. When do you want this fire to start?{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_7:village_elder_talk|I cannot do such a dangerous thing for 200 silver stags.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_9:village_elder_ask_set_fire_10|Continue with your preparations. One hour from now, I need that fire.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_9:village_elder_ask_set_fire_11|Do this at the stroke of midnight. I will wait exactly one hour.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_10:close_window|Very well, {ser/my lady}. We will make our preparations. Now you make yours.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_set_fire_11:close_window|As you wish, {ser/my lady}. May the Gods protect you.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_recruit_start|I need help finding men who want to join me. Of course, there's a reward of 100 coins in it for you.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_talk:village_elder_ask_dog|Are there any stray dogs here?{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_dog:village_elder_pretalk|Yes, recently I saw a stray dog. He was begging for food, but nobody here needs a new dog. I think he is currently sitting somewhere around here.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_ask_dog:village_elder_pretalk.1|No, I haven't seen any stray dog here recently. {***};;
dlga_village_elder_talk:close_window|[Leave]{***};;
dlga_village_elder_buy_cattle:village_elder_buy_cattle_2|We have {reg5} heads of cattle, each for {reg6} silver stags. How many do you want to buy?{***};;

dlga_village_elder_buy_cattle_2:village_elder_pretalk|Forget it.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_buy_cattle_complete:village_elder_pretalk|I will tell the herders to round up the animals and bring them to you, {ser/madam}. I am sure you will be satisfied with your purchase.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_recruit_start:village_elder_talk|I don't think anyone would be interested, {ser/madam}. Is there anything else I can do for you?{***};;
dlga_village_elder_recruit_start:village_elder_recruit_decision|I can think of {reg5} whom I suspect would jump at the chance. If you could pay {reg0} silver stags {reg7?each for their equipment:for his equipment}. Does that suit you?{***};;
dlga_village_elder_recruit_decision:village_elder_pretalk|Tell {reg7?them:him} to make ready.{***};;

dlga_village_elder_active_mission_1:village_elder_active_mission_2|Yes {ser/madam}, have you made any progress on it?{***};;
dlga_village_elder_active_mission_2:village_elder_deliver_grain_thank|Indeed. I brought you {reg5} packs of grain.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_deliver_grain_thank:village_elder_deliver_grain_thank_2|My good {lord/lady}. You have saved us from hunger and desperation. We cannot thank you enough, but you'll always be in our prayers. The village of {s13} will not forget what you have done for us.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_deliver_grain_thank_2:village_elder_talk|My good {lord/lady}, please, is there anything I can do for you?{***};;
dlga_village_elder_active_mission_2:village_elder_active_mission_3|I am still working on it.{***};;

dlga_village_elder_active_mission_3:village_elder_pretalk|Thank you, {ser/madam}. We are praying for your success everyday.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_mission_failed:village_elder_pretalk|Ah, I am sorry to hear that {ser/madam}. I'll try to think of something else.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_request_mission_ask:village_elder_pretalk|Well {ser/madam}, you are already engaged with a task helping us. We cannot ask more from you.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_request_mission_ask:village_elder_pretalk.1|No {ser/madam}, We don't have any other tasks for you.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_request_mission_ask:village_elder_tell_mission|A task?{***};;
dlga_village_elder_tell_mission:village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission|{My good ser/My good lady}, our village has been going through such hardships lately. The harvest has been bad, and recently some merciless bandits took away our seed grain that we had reserved for the planting season. If we cannot find some grain soon, we will not be able to plant our fields and then we will have nothing to eat for the coming year. If you can help us, we would be indebted to you forever.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission:village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_2|Hmmm. How much grain do you need?{***};;
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission:village_elder_deliver_grain_mission_reject|I can't be bothered with this. Ask help from someone else.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_2:village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_3|I think {reg5} packs of grain will let us start the planting. Hopefully, we can find charitable people to help us with the rest.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_3:village_elder_deliver_grain_mission_accept|Then I will go and find you the grain you need.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_grain_mission_3:village_elder_deliver_grain_mission_reject|I am afraid I don't have time for this. You'll need to find help elsewhere.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_deliver_grain_mission_accept:close_window|Thank you, {ser/madam}. We'll be praying for you night and day.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_deliver_grain_mission_reject:close_window|Yes {ser/madam}, of course. I am sorry if I have bothered you with our troubles.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_tell_mission:village_elder_tell_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission|We are suffering greatly at the hands of a group of bandits. They take our food and livestock, and kill anyone who doesn't obey them immediately. Our men are angry that we cannot defend ourselves, but we are only simple farmers... However, with some help, I think that some of the people here could be more than that. We just need an experienced warrior to teach us how to fight.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_tell_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission:village_elder_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission_accept|I can teach you how to defend yourself.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_tell_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission:village_elder_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission_reject|You peasants have no business taking up arms. Just pay the bandits and be off with it.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission_accept:close_window|You will? Oh, splendid! We would be deeply indebted to you, {ser/madam}. I'll instruct the village folk to assemble here and receive your training. If you can teach us how to defend ourselves, I promise you'll receive everything we can give you in return for your efforts.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_train_peasants_against_bandits_mission_reject:close_window|Yes, of course {ser/madam}. Thank you for your counsel.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_tell_mission:village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission|Bandits have driven away our cattle. Our pastures are empty. If we had just a few heads of cattle we could start to raise a herd again.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission:village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission_2|How many animals do you need?{***};;
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission:village_elder_deliver_cattle_mission_reject|I don't have time for this. Ask help from someone else.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission_2:village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission_3|I think {reg5} heads will suffice for a small herd.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission_3:village_elder_deliver_cattle_mission_accept|Then I will bring you the cattle you need.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_tell_deliver_cattle_mission_3:village_elder_deliver_cattle_mission_reject|I am afraid I don't have time for this. You'll need to find help elsewhere.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_deliver_cattle_mission_accept:close_window|Thank you, {ser/madam}. We'll be praying for you night and day.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_deliver_cattle_mission_reject:close_window|Yes {ser/madam}, of course. I am sorry if I have bothered you with our troubles.{***};;
dlga_village_elder_tell_mission:village_elder_pretalk|Thank you, {ser/madam}, but we do not really need anything right now.{***};;
dlga_start:goods_merchant_talk|{My lord/my lady}, you honour my humble shop with your presence.{***};;
dlga_start:goods_merchant_talk.1|Welcome {ser/madam}. What can I do for you?{***};;
dlga_goods_merchant_pretalk:goods_merchant_talk|Anything else?{***};;
dlga_goods_merchant_talk:goods_trade_requested|I want to buy a few items... and perhaps sell some.{***};;
dlga_goods_trade_requested:goods_trade_completed|Sure, sure... Here, have a look at my stock...{***};;
dlga_goods_trade_completed:goods_merchant_talk|Anything else?{***};;
dlga_goods_merchant_talk:trade_info_request|What goods should I buy here to trade with other towns?{***};;
dlga_goods_merchant_talk:trade_historia|What is this place?{***};;
dlga_trade_historia:goods_merchant_talk|This here's a gold mine, passed it's glory days for sure though. Between you and me we've found no gold for months!{***};;
dlga_goods_merchant_talk:trade_historia2|What is this place?{***};;
dlga_trade_historia2:goods_merchant_talk|This place? Its an iron mine, all the iron used in the Iron Islands come from mines like this one.{***};;
dlga_goods_merchant_talk:close_window|Nothing. Thanks.{***};;
dlga_trade_info_request:trade_info_request_2|That information can be best obtained from caravan masters and travelling merchants. If you want I can send you to the district where foreign merchants stay at when they come to the town. If you spend some time there and listen to the talk, you can learn a lot about what to buy and where to sell it.{***};;
dlga_trade_info_request_2:close_window|Then I'll go and spend some time with these merchants.{***};;
dlga_trade_info_request_2:goods_merchant_pretalk|I have no time for this right now.{***};;
dlga_start:arena_intro_1.1|Good day friend. If you came to watch the tournaments you came in vain. There won't be a tournament here any time soon.{***};;
dlga_arena_intro_1:arena_intro_2|Tournaments? So they hold the tournaments here...{***};;
dlga_arena_intro_2:arena_intro_3|Yes. You should see this place during one of the tournament fights. Everyone from the town and nearby villages comes here. The crowd becomes mad with excitement. Anyway, as I said, there won't be an event here soon, so there isn't much to see. Except, there is an official duel every now and then, and, of course, we have melee fights almost every day.{***};;
dlga_arena_intro_3:arena_training_melee_intro|Tell me about the melee fights.{***};;
dlga_arena_training_melee_intro:arena_training_melee_intro_2|The fighters and knights get bored waiting for the next tournament, so they have invented the training melee. It is a simple idea really. Fighters jump into the arena with a weapon. There are no rules, no teams. Everyone beats at each other until there is only one fighter left standing. Sounds like fun, eh?{***};;
dlga_arena_training_melee_intro_2:arena_training_melee_intro_reward|Is there a reward?{***};;
dlga_arena_training_melee_intro_reward:arena_training_melee_intro_2|There is, actually. Some of the wealthy townsmen offer prizes for those fighters who show great skill in the fights. If you can beat {reg1} opponents before going down, you'll earn {reg11} silver stags. You'll get {reg12} silver stags for striking down at least {reg2} opponents, {reg13} silver stags if you can defeat {reg3} opponents, and {reg14} silver stags if you can survive long enough to beat {reg4} opponents. If you can manage to be the last {man/fighter} standing, you'll earn the great prize of the fights, {reg15} silver stags. Sounds good, eh?{***};;

dlga_merchant_end:close_window|Heh! I must really be in a tight spot, to place my hopes in a passing stranger. However, something about you tells me that my trust is not misplaced. Now, go see if you can round up some volunteers.{***};;
dlga_start:merchant_quest_4e|You're alive! You're one of the lucky ones. Not many others alive I can tell you that much! A bloodbath! It seems our Lord Ned Stark has been taken prisoner, you must go warn Lord Robb Stark, these two soldiers are loyal to Ned and will accompany you to Winterfell.{***};;
dlga_start:close_window.88|You're lucky we found you when we did. We must make our way to Winterfell and warn Robb Stark. There is nothing else we can do here.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_4e:merchant_finale|OK, I shall see it done.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_4e:merchant_finale_1|I think I would rather not get involved.{***};;
dlga_merchant_finale_1:close_window|OK, suit yourself, but I think you are making a grave mistake.{***};;
dlga_merchant_finale:close_window|OK very good. You must make haste and follow the Kingsroad North. Good luck friend!{***};;
dlga_start:merchant_quest_1_prologue_1|{s1}{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_1_prologue_1:merchant_quest_1_prologue_2|You seem a little disoriented. I do not know who you are or where you're from, and, to tell you the truth, I do not care. I'm just a simple merchant, but things did not go well for me here. So, I am planning to travel to another country, peaceful and rainless, I hope. I have heard that in the East gold flows from watery fountains, so maybe I'll go try my fortune in Essos.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_1_prologue_2:merchant_quest_1_prologue_3|Anyway, I advise you, before I leave, to do the same and seek your own fortune in other lands. Westeros is a bloody ravaged swampland, and its' people nothing more than war fodder. Poverty feeds on the weak, and the strong men abuse the sword and the lance to impose their power and control over the humble ones. In order to trade we must pay heavy taxes in each city, sort out bandits and pirates, and pray that a local lord, ignorant and lazy, does not decide to get half of our merchandise to fund his next feast or war campaign.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_1_prologue_3:merchant_quest_1a|But I am overextending myself. Take my advice and go away from this hell hole. Until there is a powerful king able to succeed at imposing order, law and unity, this island will remain a vulture's feasting table. This forgotten corner of the known world is wretched to it's very roots, and there are no heroes to bring even a faint hope of peace to the good souls living here. So I say, seek your destiny elsewhere.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_1a:merchant_quest_1b|I am here to stay, Merchant. It is wrong to think that misfortunes come from the west or from the east. They originate within one's own mind.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_1a:close_window|You insult all of Westeros, you scite! You would do well to leave, because I will return and you had better not still be here.{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_1b:merchant_quest_by|Oh? Yes... that is very wise. -His face grows long as he contemplates your words.- You are brave too, I can see. Let me help you. -He hands you a small bag of silver stags.- Now you get out of here, I have work to do. Good luck stranger...{***};;
dlga_merchant_quest_by:close_window|Thank you, friend. Fair travels to you.!{***};;
dlga_start:battle_reason_stated.3|Surrender or die scum. Make your choice{***};;
dlga_battle_reason_stated:close_window|I am not afraid of you. I will fight.{***};;

dlga_free:view_char_requested|Tell me about yourself{***};;

dlga_member_direct_campaign_choice:member_direct_campaign_call_to_arms_verify|I want to start a new campaign. Let us assemble the army here.{***};;

dlga_member_give_order_invite_feast_verify:member_give_order_invite_feast_verify_2|You wish to invite the lords of the realm to a feast?{***};;
dlga_member_give_order_invite_feast_verify_2:member_give_order_invite_feast|Yes. It is time for us to strengthen the bonds that bring us together.{***};;
dlga_member_give_order_invite_feast_verify_2:member_pretalk|On second thought, this is perhaps not the time.{***};;
dlga_member_give_order_invite_feast:member_pretalk|All right then. I shall dispatch messengers informing the lords of the realm of your feast at {s4}.{***};;
dlga_member_direct_campaign_call_to_arms_verify:member_give_order_call_to_arms_verify_2|You wish to summon all lords for a new campaign?{***};;
dlga_member_give_order_call_to_arms_verify_2:member_give_order_call_to_arms|Yes. We must gather all our forces before we march on the enemy.{***};;
dlga_member_give_order_call_to_arms_verify_2:member_pretalk|On second thought, it won't be necessary to summon everyone.{***};;
dlga_member_give_order_call_to_arms:member_pretalk|All right then. I will send messengers and tell everyone to come here.{***};;
dlga_member_give_order_disband_army_verify:member_give_order_disband_army_2|You want to end the current campaign and release all lords from duty?{***};;
dlga_member_give_order_disband_army_2:member_give_order_disband_army|Yes. We no longer need all our forces here.{***};;
dlga_member_give_order_disband_army_2:member_pretalk|On second thought, it will be better to stay together for now.{***};;
dlga_member_give_order_disband_army:member_pretalk|All right. I will let everyone know that they are released from duty.{***};;
