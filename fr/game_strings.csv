str_retirement_text_1|Only too late do you realise that your money won't last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save, and you fare poorly in several desperate attempts to start adventuring again. You end up a beggar in {s9}, living on alms and the charity of the church.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_retirement_text_2|Only too late do you realise that your money won't last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save. Once every silver stag has evaporated in your hands you are forced to start a life of crime in the backstreet's of {s9}, using your skills to eke out a living robbing coppers from women and poor townsmen.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_retirement_text_3|Only too late do you realise that your money won't last. It doesn't take you long to fritter away what little you bothered to save, and you end up a penniless drifter, going from tavern to tavern blagging drinks from indulgent patrons by regaling them with war stories that no one ever believes.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_retirement_text_4|The silver you've saved doesn't last long, but you manage to put together enough to buy some land near the village of {s7}. There you become a free farmer, and you soon begin to attract potential {wives/husbands}. In time the villagers come to treat you as their local hero. You always receive a place of honour at feasts, and your exploits are told and retold in the pubs and taverns so that the children may keep a memory of you for ever and ever.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_retirement_text_5|The silver you've saved doesn't last long, but it's enough to buy a small tavern in {s9}. Although the locals are wary of you at first, they soon accept you into their midst. In time your growing tavern becomes a popular feast hall and meeting place. People come for miles to eat or stay there due to your sheer renown and the epic stories you tell of your adventuring days.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_retirement_text_6|You've saved wisely throughout your career, and now your silver and your intelligence allows you to make some excellent investments to cement your future. After buying several shops and warehouses in {s9}, your shrewdness turns you into one of the most prominent merchants in town, and you soon become a wealthy {man/woman} known as much for your trading empire as your exploits in battle.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_retirement_text_7|As a landed noble, however minor, your future is all but assured. You settle in your holdfast at {s7}, administrating the village and fields, adjudicating the local courts and fulfilling your obligations to your liege lord. Occasionally your liege calls you to muster and command in his campaigns, but these stints are brief, and you never truly return to the adventuring of your younger days. You have already made your fortune. With your own hall and holdings, you've few wants that your personal wealth and the income of your lands cannot afford you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_retirement_text_8|There is no question that you've done very well for yourself. Your extensive holdings and adventuring wealth are enough to guarantee you a rich and easy life for the rest of your days. Retiring to your noble seat in {s8}, you exchange adventure for politics, and you soon establish yourself as a considerable power in your liege lord's kingdom. With intrigue to busy yourself with, your own forests to hunt, a hall to feast in and a hundred fine war stories to tell, you have little trouble making the best of the years that follow.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_retirement_text_9|As a reward for your competent and loyal service, your liege lord decrees that you be given a hereditary title, joining the major nobility of the realm. Soon you complete your investiture as lord of {s7}, and you become one of your lieges close advisor's and adjutants. Your renown garners you much subtle pull and influence as well as overt political power. Now you spend your days playing the games of power, administering your great fiefs, and recounting the old times of adventure and glory.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_retirement_text_10|Though you started from humble beginnings, your liege lord holds you in high esteem, and a ripple of shock passes through the realm when he names you to the hereditary title of {duch/duchess} of {s9}. Vast fiefs and fortunes are now yours to rule. You quickly become your lieges most trusted advisor, almost his equal and charged with much of the running of his realm, and you sit upon a throne in your own splendiferous palace as one of the most powerful figures throughout the known world.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_npc4_intro|Good day. Do you need services of a smith?{***};;;;;;;;;

str_npc6_intro|Hail and well met {ser/madam}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_intro|Good day to you. I'm Qyburn, Maester Qyburn formerly. Mayhaps you need someone to tend to your wounds or ones of your soldiers?{***};;;;;;;;;

str_npc13_intro|YOU! You're the one I'm looking for! Fetch me another drink.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_intro|Hey there. I see you're a fighter, just like me in some sense. How about some Arbor red?{***};;;;;;;;;

str_dongo_intro|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_intro|I am looking for a cowardly group of Dothraki that looted, raped, and murdered the tenants of my father’s fief while under the banner of the Brave Companions. I have already cut down six of them, but they killed my horse, squire, and my father, Ser Garibald Grey the IV, before running away.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_intro|I apologize, I was just dreaming. There is a young squire I love. I dream one day he will become a landed Knight of the Vale and marry me, but to everyone I am a bastard child, I fear it will never happen. Even the first born of a king may have nothing more than a dream.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_intro|I am Ser Shadrich of the Shady Glen and the Mad Mouse, make it quick, I must make it to Dragonstone.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_npc9_intro_response_1|I want to know where I can recruit good soldiers. Can you help me?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_intro_response_1|Greetings. You look like you're not from these parts. What's your story?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_intro_response_1|What troubles you?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_intro_response_1|I seek men of skill, not song. Are you one such?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_intro_response_1|You've mistook me for an innkeeper. By the Gods, you are huge!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_intro_response_1|With pleasure! What's your name? I am {playername}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_intro_response_1|I could be. What's your story?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_intro_response_1|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_intro_response_1|The same Thoros of Myr who climbed the walls of Pyke with a flaming sword and the first man into the breach slaughtering Ironmen by the dozen? I could use a warrior such as you.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_4_intro_response_1|Whoa, calm down lady. Do you have a name?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_intro_response_1|Apologies, but aren’t women not allowed to take up arms on the Iron Islands?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_intro_response_1|Forgive me, I was just trying to introduce myself. You are a healer?{***};;;;;;;;;

str_npc3_intro_response_2|OK. Bye, I have work to do.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_intro_response_2|You look like trouble, think I'll leave you be.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_intro_response_2|You could use some drilling yourself, old man.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_intro_response_2|No doubt. Well, good luck getting found.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_intro_response_2|I better not deal with the likes of you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_intro_response_2|Nothing at all, from one so clearly disinclined to pleasantries. Good day to you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_intro_response_2|Bugger off, rascal.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_intro_response_2|Do I look like a captain of a ship?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_intro_response_2|I'll be on my way.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_intro_response_2|Where's the honour in that?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_intro_response_2|Maybe another time.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_intro_response_2|I don't drink with common soldiers.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_intro_response_2|Not at this time, no.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_intro_response_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;

str_4_intro_response_2|Obviously, you are just another crazy wildling.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_intro_response_2|Whoa, I think I better leave...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_intro_response_2|Apologies, I thought you were the local whore.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_daughter_intro_response_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_intro_response_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_backstory_a|Well, {ser/madame}, I am Syrio Forel. I am a swordsman trained in the art of the River Dance.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_backstory_a|I sell my services to the highest bidder.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_backstory_a|I hope not!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_backstory_a|Well, actually maybe you could help me.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_backstory_a|Probably due to two things - I am a warrior and I have managed to reach old age. Do you know a lot of old warriors? I can only think of Ser Barristan Selmy, Ser Brynden Tully and myself. I believe that fact is convincing enough.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_backstory_a|I am Ser Barristan Selmy, some call me Barristan the Bold. I served Robert in Kingsguard and council. Also served with the Kingslayer and others near as bad, who soiled the white cloak I wore.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_backstory_a|Well, I studied at the Citadel and was as skilled in the arts of healing as Maester Ebrose. I sought to surpass him though and did something that the archmaesters considered a terrible crime.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_backstory_a|Ah. Well, if you must know, I shall tell you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_backstory_a|Soldiers? Why would you need this lot? In fact, I used t' be a soldier once. Dick Crabb's my name, also called Nimble Dick. You must've heard of me. Fought in many battles, won myself so much glory I have to be discreet 'bout it not to draw too much attention.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_backstory_a|Story? Xhondo has no story. Xhondo mates on Cinnamon Wind, trades honestly in Jade Sea, Narrow Sea and Summer Sea.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_backstory_a|My name is Hibald. I am a travelling merchant and make my bread on the road. My cart has been recently waylaid by a band of deserters. They took everything save my clothes. I would have fought them but I'm no fighter.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_backstory_a|They do not make songs of knights of no repute! Why, I fought valiantly in the Siege of Pyke during the Greyjoy Rebellion. I still remember turning Botley castle and Lordsport to ruins before we launched our attack on Pyke.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_backstory_a|Of course I AM huge! You cannot cut down whole armies with little arms like yours! Can you even wield a battleaxe? My name is Shagga son of Dolf. I am leader of the Stone Crows of the Mountains of the Moon.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_backstory_a|I'm Anguy. Anguy the Archer. You could've heard my name in King's Landing after I won that archery competition during the Tourney of the Hand. Out shot that Kingsguard knight Ser Balon Swann and Jalabhar Xho, some exiled prince.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_backstory_a|Very well my lord. I am Podrick of House Payne.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_backstory_a|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_backstory_a|I am good in a scrap, anyone who ever fought me in a tourney can tell you that. While I am a priest of R'hllor my love for the vices of drink, women, and a good fight make certain I'm never too successful in that occupation. However, I still pray and speak the spells of healing taught to me.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_backstory_a|I am Dacey Mormont. Daughter of Maege Mormont and the heir to Bear Island.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_backstory_a|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_backstory_a|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_backstory_a|I fear the bastards have gotten away. Apologies, my name is Ser Beron of House Grey.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_backstory_a|My father is Robert Baratheon my mother was a mere commoner. While he and Eddard where being fostered by Jon Arryn, Robert took more than a moments pleasure with my mother.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_backstory_a|There is a rumour that Stannis Baratheon intends to march on King’s Landing. While others rush to the clash of arms at tourneys to show fake valour, I prefer to rush towards war and battle.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_backstory_a|I am Val of the Freefolk the sister in-law to Mance Rayder, I am looking for a person who can help us against the White Walkers. You look at me with that crazy stare. That same look all the Southerners give me. I can tell you don't believe me.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_backstory_a|Tell that to Captain Greyjoy, she would laugh at that joke just before she put her suckling babe between your ribs.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_backstory_a|I am an Orphan of the Greenblood, most of us know quite a bit of ancient healing arts of Rhoyne, though I am specifically trained to be a healer.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_daughter_backstory_a|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_backstory_a|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_backstory_b|I was once the first sword of Braavos. I can be your personal bodyguard or I can train your peasants and recruits if needed.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_backstory_b|Though don't get me mixed up as a friend or a sworn sword, this is strictly business and I do this only for gold.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_backstory_b|I've seen your sort before.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_backstory_b|I was at Kings Landing when the Starks household were slain. I managed to escape with the Night's Watch but we were ambushed.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_backstory_b|I haven't fought in the War of the Ninepenny Kings like Ser Barristan or Ser Brynden but I've had my share of fights and skirmishes. And you've certainly heard that my ancestor destroyed House Lothston of Harrenhal, haven’t you?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_backstory_b|I might be serving in King's Landing still if the vile boy upon the Iron Throne had not cast me aside, it shames me to admit. But when he took the cloak the White Bull had draped about my shoulders, and sent men to kill me that selfsame day, it was as though he'd ripped a caul off my eyes.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_backstory_b|Instead of opening the bodies of the dead to discover the secrets of the living, I opened the bodies of the still living to discover the secrets of death. When this was discovered, I was stripped from my position as a Maester.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_backstory_b|I am a woman wanting to be knight. Unfortunately kin don't see so kindly.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_backstory_b|Renowned legendary hero Ser Clarence Crabb used t' be my ancestor. He must've been the one that I inherited swordsmanship from. They say he was so huge and heavy only an aurochs could carry him. I didn't inherit that, though.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_backstory_b|Captain Quhuru Mo then says Xhondo is a thief and there is no place for Xhondo on Cinnamon Wind. Xhondo is no thief, but Quhuru Mo is captain.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_backstory_b|The constable in these parts is too preoccupied with the war to lift a finger in my defence. And without two coins to rub together I certainly can't scrounge up some sellswords to take back my belongings.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_backstory_b|It was a glorious battle! I slew twenty of the Ironborn before taking injury. But for that well struck blow I would have been among the first into the breach of the castle, alongside Thoros of Myr and Jorah Mormont.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_backstory_b|Don't stare at me like that or I'll feed your manhood to the goats! Anyway, I wanted another drink. INNKEEP! Hurry with that mead or this inn of yours will lie in ruin before dawn!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_backstory_b|Lord Stark offered me to join the Hand's Guard but I know better than to be a guardsman. So he sent me off with the Lightning Lord to execute that giant of an outlaw - The Mountain. Only, after king Robert had died, WE became the outlaws.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_backstory_b|I used to squire for a Hedge Knight; Ser Lorimer. My lord was in charge of Tywin Lannister's baggage train, but he ended up stealing food from it. He shared it with me. And, well, it was found out. We were both to be hanged but I was spared because of my family name, and was exiled.{***};;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_backstory_b|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_backstory_b|I was on a mission to capture Gregor Clegane by Eddard Stark before he was executed for treason. Stuck behind enemy lines I helped found the Brotherhood Without Banners, with Beric Dondarrion trying to protect the small folk from the ravages of war.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_3_backstory_b|As long as the Vale is at peace I have to find worthy work amongst other lords.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_backstory_b|They are real and you better believe that when winter comes, we are all in trouble. That precious wall will not save any king or queen this time.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_backstory_b|I used to be Captain Greyjoy’s helmsman on her flag ship 'Black Wind' then she told me it is time for me to make a name of my own.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_backstory_b|Unfortunately, times are hard, and I need to find work to support my family.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_backstory_b|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_backstory_b|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_backstory_b|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_backstory_c|I was not chosen as the first sword of Braavos due to strength, speed or youthfulness. But I see while others are blind.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_backstory_c|My loyalty lies with whoever has the biggest bag of gold, and it looks like you have plenty in those pockets of yours.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_backstory_c|So desperate... willing to do anything...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_backstory_c|So here I am, hiding but not knowing where to go. I used to be a blacksmith when back in Kings Landing, maybe I could be of use to you, if you were to keep me safe I could travel with you?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_backstory_c|Unfortunately, people tend to judge others by the looks and I look too old to wreak carnage in battles. I do have enough knowledge of arms, riding and tactics to turn a green squire into a seasoned fighter though, don't you doubt it.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_backstory_c|That was when I knew I must find my true {king/queen}, and die in {his/her} service.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_backstory_c|I then joined The Brave Companions as a means to survive. But in that company of criminals and outcasts I didn't feel safe at all and was constantly uneasy about my life. So I left and had been searching for someone who values the skill but not the title ever since.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_backstory_c|Perhaps you're in need of assistance? Following yourself and your companions I could prove myself.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_backstory_c|As a matter o' fact, three members o' my House served in the Kingsguard. So if it's an honest and seasoned soldier you're looking for, go no farther. I'm available and you can enlist me right now.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_backstory_c|They will not have Xhondo aboard. So Xhondo is left in Oldtown to care for himself in this place Xhondo knows so little about.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_backstory_c|When King Robert died so did the King's Peace, it seems. The war is good business, but the risk is too high. Now I have to start from scratch, but with the loans I took up I'm more like to become a dead man.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_backstory_c|But even the greatest deeds such as mine fade in time and so I'm travelling around the realm seeking honour and glory. Perhaps you would want Ser Creighton Longbough to add his sword to yours in battles to come?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_backstory_c|You're not looking for warriors, are you? I was with the Lannister little lord but guarding his dwarf arse is not for me. I took my pay and my steel battleaxe with me and left. I want to SPILL BLOOD, not stand guard by the door!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_backstory_c|We still kept our oath though and remained the King's men. Lord Beric and I, we had different views on justice. I shot brigands and hanged them, he let them have a trial by battle and entrusted their fates to the Red God. In the end, our ways had parted.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_backstory_c|So here I am, a young squire looking for a skilled commander to serve.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_backstory_c|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_backstory_c|Now I am here, drinking wine whilst deciding what to do next with my sorry life.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_backstory_c|Though I would not mind getting a head start and it looks as though you could use an extra pair of hands.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_backstory_c|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_backstory_c|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_backstory_c|I don't suppose you have seen the Brotherhood without Banners or know where I can find them?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_backstory_c|Makes no difference really, I dream things that shall never be unless I can find an opportunity to elevate my status.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_backstory_c|Perhaps you would be willing to travel with me?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_backstory_c|We need to spread the word. Get help and convince the Lord Commander to allow free passage for the Free Folk. We are as good as dead staying where we are.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_backstory_c|So here I am, though to be honest, it has been hard to find good recruits. I could use some more stags and maybe a few more battles to really make a name for myself.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_backstory_c|Maybe you are needing someone to help rid your wounded soldiers of infection?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_backstory_c|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_backstory_c|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_backstory_c|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_backstory_later|Of course. My services are always available.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_backstory_later|Aha, decided honour has got you no where? I think you need a man like me by your side. I've been running errands for Tyrion, selling my sword here and there and drinking, aye. So, have you scraped together a fortune to afford my blade?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_backstory_later|Here you are again.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_backstory_later|I have been applying myself to any work available to make some coin and scrape by. Have you found yourself in need of a good smith?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_backstory_later|I have been wandering around the Seven Kingdoms looking for a commander that would value my skill and experience in battle and give me a decent work but I have found none yet. Maybe you are the one?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_backstory_later|I have been travelling the Seven Kingdoms honing my skills.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_backstory_later|I have been treating the locals with their numerous diseases and somehow managing to scrape along. Perhaps you need my services?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_backstory_later|You still in need of a knight in your ranks?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_backstory_later|I've been here and 'bout doing all kinds of things. You still need a good sword and a source o' any information?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_backstory_later|Xhondo has been looking for work but people only say: ^'Yes-yes, Xhondo. I will come tomorrow.' ^Then people disappear. Will you take Xhondo aboard?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_backstory_later|I've been escaping the loan sharks all over the Seven Kingdoms and trying to get by. I haven't yet found anyone interested in my trading expertise. Perhaps you could use a man like me?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_backstory_later|I have been looking for opportunities to give the bards and minstrels yet another cause to sing of Ser Creighton Longbough again. Have you come here seeking my valour in battle?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_backstory_later|I've been offering my axe to some lords in these parts but they dare laugh in my face! If not for a hundred guards around each of them, I would've cut them all to scraps and fed them to the goats!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_backstory_later|I've been earning some dragons by out shooting some confident archers and spending them on whores and wine. Do you perchance need a man deadly with a bow?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_backstory_later|I've been fighting in the war for our common liege.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_backstory_later|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_backstory_later|The Lord needed my services for a while, now I'm back to roaming taverns drinking wine.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_backstory_later|My liege had called the banners since we last spoke. Though some extra experience still wouldn't hurt.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_backstory_later|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_backstory_later|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_backstory_later|I have certainly killed more than my share of Lannisters, but vengeance does not feed my family's vassals.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_backstory_later|Nice to see you again, have you changed your mind?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_backstory_later|Perhaps it is time that you decided that you need my sword.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_backstory_later|Perhaps the Old Gods are trying to tell you that you should help my people, with our continued meetings.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_backstory_later|Finding good help is always difficult, my offer still stands.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_backstory_later|Amazing you are still alive. I figured a scratch would become infected and had killed you by now.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_backstory_later|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_backstory_later|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_backstory_later|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_backstory_response_1|I believe I can afford it. You seem able enough.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_backstory_response_1|Well, perhaps I could offer you work. Can you fight?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_backstory_response_1|Ummm..{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_backstory_response_1|Well, maybe you could be useful. But I expect you to pull your weight like every other man in my following.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_backstory_response_1|I definitely need such a battle-hardened warrior in my service.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_backstory_response_1|Ah, Ser Barristan Selmy. Yes, I've heard much about you. As valiant and honourable as any man. So I've been told.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_backstory_response_1|I certainly need a man of your talents in my company.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_backstory_response_1|I can offer you opportunities to prove yourself worthy of a female warrior.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_backstory_response_1|I'd like to have such a glorious warrior in my host.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_backstory_response_1|I do need a skilled sailor to assist me with handling the ship.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_backstory_response_1|A man of your talents would be a welcome addition to my host.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_backstory_response_1|If you can swing your sword the way you spin tales, I could make use of you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_backstory_response_1|Come with me and you shall bathe in blood.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_backstory_response_1|I could really use a man with such an expertise in archery.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_backstory_response_1|Well, as it happens, I am looking for someone as yourself in my command.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_backstory_response_1|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_backstory_response_1|And what happened to Gregor Clegane, does he still roam the Riverlands doing as he pleases?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_backstory_response_1|Well I could certainly use a pair of something and I already have enough hands, if you follow my meaning?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_backstory_response_1|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_backstory_response_1|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_backstory_response_1|I have not sorry. Though perhaps you could find a way as a member of my company instead?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_backstory_response_1|I may have just the opportunity for you. How is your sword arm?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_backstory_response_1|I am actually looking for skilled warriors to join me are you interested?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_backstory_response_1|Help against fairy tails and children’s stories. Well, at least you are pretty enough to listen to.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_backstory_response_1|I could possibly use someone with your talents, I could also throw some stags your way for your services.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_backstory_response_1|Funny you should mention it, I am indeed in need of a healer.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_backstory_response_1|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_backstory_response_1|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_backstory_response_1|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_backstory_response_2|I've no need for you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_backstory_response_2|I know better than to deal with sellswords.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_backstory_response_2|OK sling your hook.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_backstory_response_2|I don't deal with escaped criminals.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_backstory_response_2|I need the young and the strong, not old sorry lot like you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_backstory_response_2|Well, if you were no good for that boy King then you are certainly no good for me. Good day.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_backstory_response_2|By the Gods, you're a necromancer! Stay away from me!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_backstory_response_2|Well, good luck.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_backstory_response_2|Tell your tales to some tavern wench.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_backstory_response_2|Xhondo can keep searching. I have no need of a sailor.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_backstory_response_2|I've no need for a merchant at this time.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_backstory_response_2|If you care so much for songs, become a bard. I will look elsewhere for warriors.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_backstory_response_2|Another time, Shaggy.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_backstory_response_2|I shall tell the guardsmen about you, criminal.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_backstory_response_2|Good luck finding him.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_backstory_response_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_backstory_response_2|I have no need for a priest or a drunk! Goodbye.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_backstory_response_2|I have no time to look after women that may get hurt.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_backstory_response_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_backstory_response_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_backstory_response_2|Nope, but good luck on your search.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_backstory_response_2|I wish you good luck.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_backstory_response_2|Farewell and good luck.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_backstory_response_2|Help against fairy tails and children’s stories. No thanks.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_backstory_response_2|I should probably just leave you to your business.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_backstory_response_2|You should go back home.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_backstory_response_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_backstory_response_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_backstory_response_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_signup|{Ser/Madame} -- I will serve you with honour.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_signup|Of course I can fight, perhaps you would like a demonstration? I could rip your heart out while you stand.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_signup|So you want my help, eh?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_signup|Sure, I can fight too if needed. I wont let you down.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_signup|Excellent. Finally my search has come to an end and I can devote myself to what I'm best at - drilling troops. You won't have to look after me on the field, I will handle myself well enough since the Warrior rides with me in battles.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_signup|If you would have me join your service I would be glad to assist you while I find who it is I am looking for.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_signup|Thank you, Sire. I am able to treat any wound and cure any known poison. My knowledge of healing arts will save a lot of soldiers that follow you into battles.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_signup|Then I shall accept your offer. But, believe me, I will prove myself to be the best warrior in your ranks. {***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_signup|And you're right in that will o' yours! I can also find trails in different areas that would otherwise remain unseen to you and your party.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_signup|Xhondo will serve well. Xhondo knows many tongues, a little. And how to use a blade.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_signup|You'll find few merchants as skilled in the art of trade as I am. I've bought priceless works of art for pennies and sold junk for castles. I can point out the best deals, haggle down prices and help organize your finances.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_signup|I spin nothing for I am a knight, not a tailor! I assure you that when swords clash, you shall never find me in the rear. Should the day come that I lose my life in battle, my foes will be piled all around me!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_signup|Just point me at your enemies and I will cleave through them. Shagga son of Dolf never fails and never falls.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_signup|There's no finer archer than me in the Seven Kingdoms. Ensure that I am stationed on some solid ground and I'll rain down death on your enemies. I am also a skilled spotter and tracker.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_signup|You do? Well, I am very fortunate to have come across you today!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_signup|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_signup|That is now none of my concern, what with the good Eddard Stark having no head un'all.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_signup|Lucky for you I shall ignore that comment, though next time you shall not be so courteous.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_signup|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_signup|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_signup|I would gladly serve you, if only to do a single good deed.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_signup|My sword arm is just fine, I am used to fighting off a Stone Crow or two taking people to the Eyrie.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_signup|Firstly, I should ask you not to run from a battle, win or lose, every battle offers a man a chance to win glory.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_signup|I did not cross the wall to tell stories. If I can’t persuade people to help, we will all be dead when winter comes.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_signup|I guess I could be willing to work for someone like you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_signup|I would be happy to serve you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_signup|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_signup|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_signup|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_signup_2|Your soldiers will be all the better for me joining you, hopefully you may even live a little while longer.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_signup_2|The better you pay the better I fight.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_signup_2|Very well.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_signup_2|Though I trust you wont turn me in the first sign of trouble?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_signup_2|There are two conditions of my service, though. Do not flee from battles and do not pay off brigands to gain passage through the land. Otherwise all my work will be undone in the blink of an eye, soldiers don't serve under cravens.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_signup_2|I've heard rumours of a Targaryen girl across the narrow sea gathering an army. Maybe that's where we should be headed.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_signup_2|I want to point out though that since I will tend to your soldiers and they are an awful lot even in good mood, you should not let them starve, cut down their pay or allow them to be butchered on the field of battle.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_signup_2|I shall be pleased to fight in your shield-wall. But I warn you -- if you ask me to gather the firewood, or cook a meal, you will not like the consequences.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_signup_2|I know as well where t' look after battle's done for things o' most value. Therefore I ask that you don't leave Ol' Dick without my share of loot and a tasty chunk of meat by the fire.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_signup_2|Xhondo wants his belly full with food and drinks and his pockets ringing with coins. Or Xhondo will be much displeased.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_signup_2|It'll be good to chase after the bandits rather than run from them for once. But I am a merchant first of all and you should know that it would ruin my name were I to be associated with a band of raiders and looters.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_signup_2|No doubt some lord will seek out my service in the near future, but I hear you are bound for great perils. You shall definitely have need of my steel, and the arm that wields it! I ask only that we do not flee from the field of battle, there is no honour in that.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_signup_2|Just make sure there's always enough food and coin to supply my needs. No man can fight with a hunger in his belly and no good warrior can skip a good feast after the battle is won!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_signup_2|It feels great to take up arms again. You won't find me generous with brigands we will encounter, if you get the meaning. And keep in mind that I won't tolerate robbing peasants and burning down villages.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_signup_2|I will not let you down. I think you will find me a valuable addition to your ranks. I will serve you faithfully, my lord.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_signup_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_signup_2|So I guess it’s either live as an outlaw bringing justice to those who think they are above it, or joining someone such as yourself to make the world a better place.  I warn you though do not prey on the weak or defenceless and I value your men’s lives and although I may be able to resurrect some of our dead with the Last Kiss, the flames of life consume and they will never be the same.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_signup_2|Should I join you, I shall need to get some provisions and send a raven to Winterfell to tell them I may be delayed.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_signup_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_signup_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_signup_2|I may not be able to get revenge for my family’s tenants, but if you pay me enough stags, I could ensure they can buy enough supplies to get them back on their feet.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_signup_2|I will need some equipment before we leave though.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_signup_2|Only then I will pledge you my blade.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_signup_2|So, are you willing to help or am I wasting my time here?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_signup_2|Just don’t be a pussy and run from battles, I need the fame.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_signup_2|But first let me tell you this, my skills are far above those of a Maester’s. Not only can I heal the wounded, I can tend to some of the most gruesome wounds and prevent scaring.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_signup_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_signup_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_signup_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_signup_response_1|Well, it seems you could be useful to us.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_signup_response_1|You can prove your prowess in battle.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_signup_response_1|I.. OK.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_signup_response_1|Of course not, I'm loyal to my men and you have my word Gendry.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_signup_response_1|You have my word that my command meets your conditions.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_signup_response_1|I'm sure a man of your stature could become very useful on our travels.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_signup_response_1|I am a reasonable strategist and won't allow that to happen.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_signup_response_1|No fear, friend. You're a warrior, and you'll be treated accordingly.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_signup_response_1|Why would I deceive such an honest man?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_signup_response_1|We have plenty of food and coin for everyone. Welcome to our party.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_signup_response_1|I understand, and rest assured your worries are unfounded with me.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_signup_response_1|I never run from battles - I seek them.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_signup_response_1|There's never a shortage of food and coin in my camp. We shall feast on our victories!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_signup_response_1|I share your views. Let us clear the land from this rabble together.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_signup_response_1|Good! Get your stuff ready, and meet me outside.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_signup_response_1|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_signup_response_1|It is a reasonable request, I will try my best to honour them. Though war does make some men monsters.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_signup_response_1|Very well, I could always use a she-bear from the Bear Islands.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_signup_response_1|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_signup_response_1|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_signup_response_1|How many stags do you require?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_signup_response_1|Ok but hurry along we leave soon.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_signup_response_1|I share your sentiments friend. I fight every battle to last of my dyeing breath.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_signup_response_1|OK. Perhaps we could help each other, I need a persuasive envoy.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_signup_response_1|I think I can honour that deal.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_signup_response_1|Good! Get your stuff ready, and meet me outside.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_signup_response_1|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_signup_response_1|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_signup_response_1|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_signup_response_2|Hmm, I'm too busy for this. Good day, ser.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_signup_response_2|I'm afraid you are not who I'm looking for.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_signup_response_2|Actually no, I think you are pretty useless.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_signup_response_2|On second thoughts, maybe its not such a good idea having you hanging around with us drawing unwanted attention.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_signup_response_2|Too much fuss over some old grumbler.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_signup_response_2|Actually, I've changed my mind. Your honour stinks like shit and I don't like it.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_signup_response_2|These are my people and I do as I please with them!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_signup_response_2|Ah. Actually, maybe I don't need a woman trying to be a knight riding with me.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_signup_response_2|You would rob even the beggars, it seems. Be gone.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_signup_response_2|Another mouth! No food for Xhondo.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_signup_response_2|I do as I please, if you don't like it then stay here.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_signup_response_2|An over-weight, over-confident hedge knight will only slow me down.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_signup_response_2|You'll devour my food inventories!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_signup_response_2|I deal with low-born as I please.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_signup_response_2|On second thought, wars might be too dangerous for you. Sorry lad.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_signup_response_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_signup_response_2|Then you should be an outlaw.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_signup_response_2|In fact, your actually pretty scary, maybe I wont be needing you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_signup_response_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_signup_response_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_signup_response_2|I have no room for some goodie-two shoes.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_signup_response_2|On second thought, you are just a girl.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_signup_response_2|In fact, I have changed my mind.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_signup_response_2|I have no time for a delusional woman no matter how beautiful she is.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_signup_response_2|I wish you luck.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_signup_response_2|Sorry, but I am not interested.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_signup_response_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_signup_response_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_signup_response_2|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_payment|I will be very useful to you, {ser/madame}, you can count on that. Though I will require {reg3} silver stags for my services. One must still earn a living.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_payment|Before I sign up, I will need {reg3} stags. But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and m'lord you every time you take a shit. I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_payment|Though before I join you, I will need {reg3} coins, sharply.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_payment|I hope so. I do have one more favour though. I lost all my stags in the ambush and need to square up with the tavern keeper here in {s20}. Could you please lend me {reg3} silver stags?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_payment|Tremendous! One last thing. I require a sum of {reg3} stags before I join you. A proper soldier never enters someone's service without receiving enlistment payment first.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_payment|Sure, though I shall require {reg3} coins as payment.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_payment|That is reassuring. Before we venture on, however, I need to buy certain herbs and potions that by my estimate are worth {reg3} stags.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_payment|Then I will fight with you your enemies. But first I'm in need of {reg3} silver stags.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_payment|That's what I'm always sayin'! Anyway, an honest soldier such as me requires an honest payment before he starts fighting. All I ask is a humble sum of {reg3} stags.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_payment|Good. Xhondo has no money and asks for {reg3} stags. Now.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_payment|Thank you, you won't regret taking me along. However, there is the matter of the loans I took up. I acquired {reg3} stags for my last shipment. I cannot travel openly unless I repay the loans.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_payment|Truer words were never spoken! Now there's a small matter of payment left, I'll need {reg3} stags to pay local smith for the repair of my blade. I had notched it in a furious struggle with bandits in the countryside, you see. Plus a little for myself, of course.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_payment|I need {reg3} stags to pay for all the mead I've drunk and meat I've feasted on over these days.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_payment|Aye. There's just this one thing before we go on. I've spent last night with some expensive whores that seems to have left me broke. I require {reg3} stags to supply my need for fine wine and ladies.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_payment|I do however require {reg3} stags. I may have overspent a little, staying here far too long.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_payment|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_payment|That it does, hopefully we can escape the transformation that strikes down others. Before we leave though, I need you to take care of my tab, I warn you, it is a hefty one.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_payment|Very well, I shall need to see the master and I expect you will pay the {reg3} coins for his services and my stay here?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_payment|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_payment|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_payment|{reg3} should be enough. A hefty sum I know but nothing is cheap whilst the war still rages.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_payment|I will need {reg3} stags. You know, for my equipment.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_payment|I ask you pay me {reg3} stags upfront, this will cover my living should you die while I am in your employ, I do not want to be a poor knight.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_payment|I can be your envoy but first you must promise to raise an army to help my people and to pay me {reg3} stags as a show of your good faith so I may purchase some weapons for my people.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_payment|How does {reg3} stags, and a weekly wage sound?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_payment| I will not come cheap though, I require 9000 stags up front and a weekly wage.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_payment|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_payment|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_payment|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_payment_response|Very well, here's {reg3} silver stags.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_payment_response|Very well.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_payment_response|I wont ask... Here you go.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_payment_response|Take your {reg3} stags and be quick. We're marching soon.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_payment_response|No objections on this. Here's your {reg3} stags.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_payment_response|OK, ill pay them for you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_payment_response|Of course! Here, take {reg3} stags and purchase what you need. Meet me outside afterwards.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_payment_response|Hmm OK, here's {reg3} silver stags for you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_payment_response|Honest words from such a... seasoned soldier. Here's your {reg3} stags.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_payment_response|Fair enough. Here's {reg3} stags. Meet me outside.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_payment_response|Here is the money, {reg3} stags, see to the loans and try to come back with all your limbs.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_payment_response|The sword doesn't make the man, but take your {reg3} stags and meet me outside.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_payment_response|You certainly like to eat, Shagga. Here's {reg3} stags.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_payment_response|Here. Take {reg3} stags and make ready to leave soon.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_payment_response|Fair enough. Here's {reg3} stags, as you requested. Now get ready to move out.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_payment_response|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_payment_response|Seven hells! How much wine have you drank?! Here's your {reg3} stags.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_payment_response|Sure, here's your {reg3} stags.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_payment_response|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_payment_response|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_payment_response|Then {reg3} stags for a knightly deed.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_payment_response|Yes yes, here's your {reg3} stags.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_payment_response|Very well Ser Shadrich, grab your gear we are leaving.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_payment_response|That’s a fair deal.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_payment_response|A fair price. Welcome aboard.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_payment_response|You better be worth your 9000 stags.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_payment_response|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_payment_response|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_payment_response|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_morality_speech|It's a bit much that we {s21}. You should take a little more care in the future, if you don't mind my saying.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_morality_speech|Its not always good to {s21}. Though it does make us richer.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_morality_speech|I confess that I am somewhat shocked that we {s21}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_morality_speech|What we did back there wasn't right, Commander. I know war isn't what the bards make of it in songs but we shouldn't just {s21}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_morality_speech|Commander, if your preference is to {s21}, then my drilling of your soldiers is going to pot. And Mother have mercy on you when you finally decide to fight.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_morality_speech|Excuse me, {ser/madame}. As you know, I joined with you to right wrongs, restore my own honour. I did not expect to {s21}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_morality_speech|Sire, it is utterly disappointing when you {s21}. I will not remain for long in a company with such leadership.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_morality_speech|I was not pleased that you decided to {s21}. To fall in battle is an honour, but to fight along side a coward is a disgrace.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_morality_speech|Commander, if you {s21} why are you at the head of our army? Ol' Dick has some experience in leading troops, I can do that in your stead.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_morality_speech|Captain, you {s21}. Xhondo is not pleased.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_morality_speech|I was quite clear about the conditions of my service. If you wish to {s21} to acquire your coin then you shall have to spend it without my guidance.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_morality_speech|Commander, if you oft {s21}, your men including me might start thinking that they would be better off serving another lord or even on their own.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_morality_speech|Chief, Shagga is not going to sit idly by while you {s21}. Lead us the way it should be done or stand down and let true warriors do this!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_morality_speech|Captain, what made you {s21}? It is not what I expected of you. If you think I will waylay caravans and butcher innocents you are gravely mistaken.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_morality_speech|My lord, I don't think I can watch you murder the poor innocent souls. Please reconsider next time before doing such an action.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_morality_speech|Should we really {s21}?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_morality_speech|Look at how many men I am going to have to kiss to get things back to normal around here. I should of stayed at the tavern you found me in, at least then I could count on kissing at least one wicked woman.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_morality_speech|I would not be running from a battle if I was with King Robb Stark. Just remember, I chose you as my commander, but I can always change my mind.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_morality_speech|Captain, what made you {s21}? It is not what I expected of you. If you think I will waylay caravans and butcher innocents you are gravely mistaken.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_morality_speech|My lord, I don't think I can watch you murder the poor innocent souls. Please reconsider next time before doing such an action.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_morality_speech|My Lord, I am a knight, not a cowardly butcher! Discharge me from my oath to you or quit hurting those we should defend.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_morality_speech|If this is how you keep your promises, then I have no hope of reaching my dream.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_morality_speech|Your common mouse will run from blood and battle. The mad mouse seeks them out!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_morality_speech|You made a promise to me as well, is this what I can expect of your promises?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_morality_speech|Just one word for you my lord….Pussy{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_morality_speech|You need to find yourself a grave digger not a healer. This careless disregard for life must end if I am to stay under your command!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_morality_speech|{Father/Mother}. Should we really {s21}?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_morality_speech|{Father/Mother}. Should we really {s21}?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_morality_speech|Should we really {s21}?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_2ary_morality_speech|Next time we should not {s21}. The first sword of Braavos does not approve.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_2ary_morality_speech|Needs must. If we have to {s21} then so be it. Doing what's right will mostly always only get a man killed{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_2ary_morality_speech|I think it was the correct decision you took to {s21}. There is no shame in finding a way to avoid the spilling of blood.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_2ary_morality_speech|Its not good to {s21}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_2ary_morality_speech|Why is it you choose to {s21}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_2ary_morality_speech|{Ser/Madame} - you may choose to {s21}, but I would prefer to have no part in it.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_2ary_morality_speech|Why is it you choose to {s21}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_2ary_morality_speech|I think it was a brave decision you took to {s21}. There is no shame in finding a way to avoid the spilling of blood.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_2ary_morality_speech|Why is it you choose to {s21}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_2ary_morality_speech|Why is it you choose to {s21}.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_npc15_2ary_morality_speech|Why is it you choose to {s21}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_2ary_morality_speech|Why is it you choose to {s21}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_2ary_morality_speech|Justice. I remember justice. It had a pleasant taste.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_2ary_morality_speech|I would not be running from a battle if I was with King Robb Stark. Just remember, I chose you as my commander, but I can always change my mind{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_2ary_morality_speech|Why is it you choose to {s21}.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_event_2ary_morality_speech|Why is it you choose to {s21}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_personalityclash_speech|..{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_personalityclash_speech|I have no loyalties here, the sooner people realised that the better we all will be.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_personalityclash_speech|In my opinion, {s11} is terrible.. I cant say why.. I cant say when.. But I do know you know.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_personalityclash_speech|Commander, that merchant {s11} is a weak and slippery man. Always trying to pay men to do his work for him, never able to dirty his dainty hands with anything but counting coppers.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_personalityclash_speech|Commander, I do understand that you need able soldiers but {s11} is worst of all the sellsword scum in the realm. He's a godless man without any honour or dignity.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_personalityclash_speech|{s11}'s barbaric! I can put an end to him if you will?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_personalityclash_speech|Sire, I've come to you to talk about {s11}. He considers himself a wise and learned man yet he sees my experiments of purely scientific interest a threat to himself and our company.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_personalityclash_speech|Their is something wrong with that man!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_personalityclash_speech|Commander, this old fool {s11} thinks himself so experienced a warrior and so valiant a knight yet he has refused to get down from that horse o' his and give me, a 'simple sellsword', a hand when I needed one.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_personalityclash_speech|Captain, Xhondo knows he is not local. Xhondo tries to mate with your crew but {s11} always makes mock of Xhondo.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_personalityclash_speech|Leader, I have seen a thing or two in my life and not all of them quite pleasant. But that old man calling himself a former maester known as {s11} is the most fearful creature I've laid my eyes upon.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_personalityclash_speech|Commander, {s11} has to be the most uncouth lout I have ever had the displeasure to meet! He reeks of ale and sweat so badly that it keeps me up at night.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_personalityclash_speech|Chief, I don't like {s11} at all. He does things forbidden by the Old Gods and can call down their wrath upon us.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_personalityclash_speech|Captain, {s11} is just another of those brigands of which I've seen and slain hundreds. Sometimes I think what prevents me from making a few holes in him.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_personalityclash_speech|..{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_personalityclash_speech|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_personalityclash_speech|That jackal Qyburn served with the Brave Companions, they burned crops, maimed, tortured, raped, and murdered for nothing more that sport.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_personalityclash_speech|You would think my uncle Jeor could have at least killed this one before he got over the wall. Crastos is unworthy to serve you{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_personalityclash_speech|Wun-Wun smash!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_personalityclash_speech|Dongo don't like little human.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_personalityclash_speech|The only Red Chicken Knight he ever fought was in a pot.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_personalityclash_speech|The only thing different from Crastos and a Stone Crow is the smell, at least a Stone Crow bathes.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_personalityclash_speech|The reason Hibald is always out of breath after a battle is because he ran from it.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_personalityclash_speech|If Hibald so much as looks at me again, he will be singing a bit higher by the campfire tonight after I cut off his nuts.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_personalityclash_speech|How can you get the name Dick when you come up short?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_personalityclash_speech|Ser Shadrich is perhaps the cruellest of your knights, he seeks only to kill and maim his adversaries, wounds inflicted by him are always lethal and beyond my skill.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_personalityclash_speech|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_personalityclash_speech|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_personalityclash_speech|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_personalityclash_speech_b|A sword of Braavos expects more from a man.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_personalityclash_speech_b|He thinks he shits gold! He's no better than any other man.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_personalityclash_speech_b|This man, that man, her man, your man. Who cares? Hahahaha.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_personalityclash_speech_b|He always stays out of fighting yet he mocks me and makes fun of my way of fighting. Can we get rid of this venal creature as soon as possible?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_personalityclash_speech_b|When I told him that Seven would sort him out for all the terrible things he had done he only laughed to my face and called me an old Septon. I am a godly man, but I am also a knight and won't tolerate such blasphemy!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_personalityclash_speech_b|I am sure no one will miss him.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_personalityclash_speech_b|What can a merchant know about Maesters work? I don't interrupt him while he's haggling at the market yet he deems appropriate to disturb me in the middle of my experiments.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_personalityclash_speech_b|He thinks of women as his trophy's. He thinks to lay a hand on me and ill have him.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_personalityclash_speech_b|I understand his ass is too noble and pious to be seated near mine but he could assist me when I was knocked down by a couple of enemy horsemen nonetheless.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_personalityclash_speech_b|Xhondo is not cruel but sometimes Xhondo wants to bash the head of that jester. Xhondo wants his ship to sail.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_personalityclash_speech_b|I have never heard of a Maester losing his chains. That Qyburn must have done something very wrong to get tossed out of his order. Word is that he was caught practising the dark arts and unspeakable horrors. I do not want that man around me when I am injured and unable to fend for myself!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_personalityclash_speech_b|And when he's not devouring our stock of food he is going through our stores of ale like if he was dying of thirst. I swear it's like the King's Name day at the Quill and Tankard everyday with him!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_personalityclash_speech_b|Let me cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats and then give his neck a tickle with my battleaxe!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_personalityclash_speech_b|Moreover, he's a despicable pillager and would probably search his own dead parents for a coin. Give me leave to deal with this scum.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_personalityclash_speech_b|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_personalityclash_speech_b|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_personalityclash_speech_b|If we pass a tall tree we should hang him, and I will make especially sure I pray to the Lord of Light to roast his soul to the end of time.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_personalityclash_speech_b|We should send him back where he belongs!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_personalityclash_speech_b|Smash!!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_personalityclash_speech_b|Maybe Dongo wipe smile off humans face.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_personalityclash_speech_b|He is a disgrace to all knights and even fat slobs.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_personalityclash_speech_b|He makes no sense, always talking in riddles. I think he had a knock to the head when a small boy.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_personalityclash_speech_b|We have no need for traders of auroch shit on a battlefield.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_personalityclash_speech_b|Maybe I will fry them up whilst he watches.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_personalityclash_speech_b|What a sorry excuse of a man.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_personalityclash_speech_b|We should ditch him at the next battlefield.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_personalityclash_speech_b|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_personalityclash_speech_b|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_personalityclash_speech_b|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_personalityclash2_speech|I grow tired of {s11} and his Red God.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_personalityclash2_speech|Captain, are we recruiting all kinds of Septons and fanatics now? {s11} is only capable of praying and preaching, what makes him a good fodder but not a bit a warrior we could use.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_personalityclash2_speech|That Syrio speaks funny.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_personalityclash2_speech|Commander, that huge sailor of yours, {s11}, is a brute and a stranger to our realm. Last time we fought shoulder to shoulder he roared something incomprehensible in his own tongue and cut off man's head.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_personalityclash2_speech|Commander, {s11} is intolerable. He considers himself a great warrior from House Crabb yet he's no more than some common brigand. In the last fight I rushed to help him against two brutes and he stepped out and left me to fend for myself.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_personalityclash2_speech|....{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_personalityclash2_speech|Sire, enlisting barbarians and all kinds of hairy creatures able to fight can prove to be a grievous mistake. How do you plan to actually control that beast of a man {s11}?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_personalityclash2_speech|He calls himself a knight.. Pah!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_personalityclash2_speech|Commander, this young archer {s11} you've taken along sometimes looks at me as if I've burned down his home and murdered his family. I swear, he's like to cut my throat in my sleep.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_personalityclash2_speech|Captain, last battle Xhondo had this boy {s11} behind his back. Xhondo was attacked by group of foes and knew he was not alone.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_personalityclash2_speech|Leader, this smith boy {s11} is too naive and simple-minded to remain in our war party. He can neither fight well, nor loot the scum we're leaving behind us. And those vaunted smithing skills of his. Did he craft you anything yet?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_personalityclash2_speech|Commander, {s11} has to be the most dangerous person I have ever met. There may be better swordsmen and fighters out there, but they normally get slowed down by things like honour and mercy. Bronn, on the other hand, would probably kill a babe if he was paid well enough.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_personalityclash2_speech|Chief, blabbering wenches shouldn't be part of our warband. {s11} is always talking about his prowess but in the last battle he almost broke his toe running from the enemies.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_personalityclash2_speech|Captain, what use is this huge {s11} if he doesn't speak Common Tongue and doesn't even understand the japes me and the other soldiers make?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_personalityclash2_speech|none.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_personalityclash2_speech|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_personalityclash2_speech|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_personalityclash2_speech|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_personalityclash2_speech|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_personalityclash2_speech|none.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_personalityclash2_speech|Qyburn is one of those who killed, raped, tortured my people, and burned my home. A treacherous bastard.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_personalityclash2_speech|Nothing more than a bully, a brute that preys on the weak.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_personalityclash2_speech|The wench of Tarth had the nerve to call me short before the last battle.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_personalityclash2_speech|That Ser Illfer could not even train the tavern drunk to drink a glass of ale.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_personalityclash2_speech|Xhondu is a poor excuse for a sailor and a warrior, he would not survive an hour on the Black Wind.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_personalityclash2_speech|Qyburn is no healer, but a cruel torturer who enjoys turning everyone around him into an experiment.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_personalityclash2_speech|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_personalityclash2_speech|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_personalityclash2_speech|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_personalityclash2_speech_b|Their is only one God, and his name is death.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_personalityclash2_speech_b|He even tried to talk to me about his religion after last battle, that old begging brother! I say rid us of him and let him pray to his Seven in some shit hole sept along the road. {***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_personalityclash2_speech_b|After our last victory I was picking through the slain, found a man's arm cut clean off. It was that Syrio! That could have been my arm!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_personalityclash2_speech_b|He's done it with such an innocent look as if he remarked upon the weather during some of the usual talks around the camp. I'm not sure what sort of man he is. Safer to travel without him.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_personalityclash2_speech_b|I cannot fight alongside a man who's like to stab me in the back instead of covering it. He says he was a soldier but I don't know what use he would have been except for looting the dead - that he has been mastering over the years.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_personalityclash2_speech_b|....{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_personalityclash2_speech_b|After the last battle he let out a roar so furious and full of blood thirst that I decided it's safer to keep a healthy distance from him at all times.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_personalityclash2_speech_b|All my life men like him have sneered at me. And all my life I've been knocking men like him into the dust.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_personalityclash2_speech_b|During last battle I constantly felt his eyes upon me and expected an arrow 'nto my back all the time. I had t' worry more about that than an enemy swinging his sword in front of my face.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_personalityclash2_speech_b|But the boy just left Xhondo there to bring 'help'. All help Xhondo needed was the boy's sword. Xhondo says, splay coward's blood across the deck.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_personalityclash2_speech_b|I've seen him hesitating before finishing one of our foes off in the last battle. This boy is too green to kill people, he should be left at the first town we pass by and work there as some apprentice.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_personalityclash2_speech_b|He's got courage, and strength, but there is no kindness in him, and little loyalty. He doesn't want me coming along and makes that apparent. He says that I should stop playing at war and become a bard rather, that low-born!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_personalityclash2_speech_b|I can cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats as an example of what happens to cowards for your troops. If he has any, and I doubt that.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_personalityclash2_speech_b|And he tends to like fighting a few enemies at once. I can't always cover his big black back, he'll just end up dying on us. Better get rid of him now.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_personalityclash2_speech_b|none.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_personalityclash2_speech_b|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_personalityclash2_speech_b|....{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_personalityclash2_speech_b|Or a woman who thinks she's a knight.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_personalityclash2_speech_b|n/a{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_personalityclash2_speech_b|none.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_personalityclash2_speech_b|I warn you, his nature will never change.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_personalityclash2_speech_b|Just another obstacle I had to overcome on the path of the Eyrie.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_personalityclash2_speech_b|Today she learned I am big enough where it counts when I slew those men.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_personalityclash2_speech_b|I have seen more life and motivation in a wight than that useless excuse of a man.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_personalityclash2_speech_b|He calls himself a navigator. Pah! He cannot navigate himself out of a wet paper bag.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_personalityclash2_speech_b|My abilities far out reach his in healing, spare your men the agony of becoming his next experiment.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_personalityclash2_speech_b|... {***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_personalityclash2_speech_b|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_personalityclash2_speech_b|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_personalitymatch_speech|I was impressed with {s11}'s skills in that last battle.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_personalitymatch_speech|The last inn we stopped at, the beer was good and the women, well lets just say I've never seen finer tits in the whole of Westeros. I could have landed myself a suckle until {s11} jumped in front of me... though I do like his style. {***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_personalitymatch_speech|Do you think {s11} would like a man like me?... Obviously not me, but someone like.. me?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_personalitymatch_speech|Commander, {s11} is a worthy and just man, not to mention his expertise with bow and arrows. I feel much more confident knowing that he watches my back in battle. He has saved me a couple of times already.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_personalitymatch_speech|Commander, I just wanted to point out that you did the right thing by taking {s11} along. He knows how to fight and how to tell stories, too. His are ones of the most interesting that I've heard in a long time.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_personalitymatch_speech|The Braavosi that travels with us. I've never seen swordplay of such beauty.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_personalitymatch_speech|Sire, the Summer Islander that travels with us is an interesting person indeed. {s11} has told me some things about the rituals and medicine of his people, that I found most exciting to hear about.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_personalitymatch_speech|He's learning quick that one. Not bad with a sword either!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_personalitymatch_speech|Commander, that {s11} is a good and honest man and knows the taste o' gold better than I do. Over some goat leg and ale he started tellin' me about all the different coins, how before Stags and Dragons every Kingdom had its own coinage. You e'er heard about that? I didn't.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_personalitymatch_speech|Captain, Xhondo think {s11} is a good man and a good healer. Each time Xhondo was wounded, he cured Xhondo.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_personalitymatch_speech|Leader, {s11} is quite a good company. We were sitting by the camp fire and sharing some stories of our past and enjoying the beautiful evening. You should take a closer look at him or even promote him.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_personalitymatch_speech|Commander, I wanted to say that {s11} was certainly a great choice of yours. There are not many warriors around so experienced as our brave Ser Illifer not to mention his bloodline.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_personalitymatch_speech|Chief, that {s11} is a worthy fighter. He shows no mercy nor asks for it, just like me. He knows fighting isn't about showing off swordplay, it's about butchering the poor fool in front of you for crow food and moving on to his mates!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_personalitymatch_speech|Captain, the smith {s11} you took with us is a good and honest lad. He's not yet experienced with a blade but he makes fine weapons and armour.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_personalitymatch_speech|My lord, {s11}'s swordplay is very impressive.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_personalitymatch_speech|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_personalitymatch_speech|{s11}'s an honest lad, who detests those who prey on the weak.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_personalitymatch_speech|My uncle Jorah always said that {s11} was the bravest man he had ever seen.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_personalitymatch_speech|Wun-Wun like Dongo.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_personalitymatch_speech|Dongo like Wun-Wun.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_personalitymatch_speech|Mya is a fair and beautiful lady, I would give her my love but she only thinks of Mychel Redfort.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_personalitymatch_speech|When I look at him, there is something very familiar about him.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_personalitymatch_speech|Mormont knows a true warrior shows their skills only on the field of battle.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_personalitymatch_speech|Though she is not pretty, I bet she would give Tormund a hard on.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_personalitymatch_speech|I know Lady Val is a woman, but the things I would do with her would make even you grin.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_personalitymatch_speech|Ser Beron behaves as the knights whose legends echo in eternity.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_personalitymatch_speech|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_personalitymatch_speech|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_personalitymatch_speech|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_personalitymatch_speech_b|Without good honest folk like him here, we would all surely be doomed. I'll warrant. I'm glad to have him with us.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_personalitymatch_speech_b|Though, there's always next time aye m'lord?! heheheh.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_personalitymatch_speech_b|I also confess that I... Am I talking too much again?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_personalitymatch_speech_b|He's relentless with bandits and I cannot say I dislike that. Quite the contrary, I took to them in time. Maybe one day we will devote our lives to cause of protecting the realm from brigands.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_personalitymatch_speech_b|His blood and manners are both noble and make for a great company on the field of battle same as by the camp fire. With his sword at my side I'm not hesitating to rush into where the fight is the thickest.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_personalitymatch_speech_b|I've travelled to Braavos many a time. I've seen the swords of Braavos just a few, but this ones different.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_personalitymatch_speech_b|He doesn't speak the Common Tongue well yet he grasps the idea quickly and replies according to the point, without blabbering or changing topic. We got along quite well.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_personalitymatch_speech_b|You should be glad we have people of his nature in our company.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_personalitymatch_speech_b|He knows everything 'bout trade and we would do well to use his knowledge from time t' time. I'll help keep him out o' the fighting, we cannot afford losing such a useful member of our host.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_personalitymatch_speech_b|He knows things of Summer Islands and teaches Xhondo your Westerosi Tongue. One day Xhondo will best your kings at talking.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_personalitymatch_speech_b|He is a formidable and experienced soldier, after all and knows which things shine the brightest. A rather reticent and unremarkable but yet invaluable member of our warband.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_personalitymatch_speech_b|I consider it a great honour to fight alongside him and I gladly share bread and mead with him after battles. Perhaps we shall seek fortune together one day.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_personalitymatch_speech_b|And he knows how to drink and feast! Last night we have eaten up a whole ox and drunken 2 casks of mead! Any man that dares attack Bronn I'll tear asunder with my own bare hands!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_personalitymatch_speech_b|He also has a proper sense of what's right and just in this world, I like that. Men like this lad won't betray you or stab you in the back.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_personalitymatch_speech_b|She knows her limits, and executes every attack perfectly! I'm glad to have someone like her by my side. You made good sense by bringing her to our company.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_personalitymatch_speech_b|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_personalitymatch_speech_b|There is also no better archer.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_personalitymatch_speech_b|You did well to bring him to our cause, even if he is half drunk by breakfast.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_personalitymatch_speech_b|Dongo fights like giant. Giants fight well.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_personalitymatch_speech_b|Together we smash our foes!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_personalitymatch_speech_b|That boy is either confused or a fool.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_personalitymatch_speech_b|It is almost as I am looking in a Mirror.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_personalitymatch_speech_b|She is honourable and full of charisma.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_personalitymatch_speech_b|I know the way he looks at her.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_personalitymatch_speech_b|I hope you are not blushing {playername}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_personalitymatch_speech_b|You did well to hire such a noble man.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_personalitymatch_speech_b|....{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_personalitymatch_speech_b|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_personalitymatch_speech_b|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_retirement_speech|I'm a bit tired of marching up and down the land, shedding my blood for someone else's cause. I'm going to head back to Braavos, see some old friends. I think a deserve a vacation, after all.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_retirement_speech|Your gold is lacking and I've had better offers elsewhere. Its time for me to move on.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_retirement_speech|I am afraid I have something to tell you. I know you will be very upset for loosing such an honourable and gallant knight.. but I'm leaving.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_retirement_speech|Commander, I think I will be staying in the next town we get to. I don't feel like I'm doing what I was meant to do fighting for you. Thank you for bringing me along but I yearn for the heat of the smithy more than the fires of battle.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_retirement_speech|Commander, perhaps it is time I seek some rest for my old bones. I can no longer remain as stalwart in battles as I used to be and, sadly, that means I'm a done fighter. Possibly we will meet again.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_retirement_speech|It seems my call has been answered else where. I'm here to tell you that I must regretfully leave your companionship now.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_retirement_speech|Sire, it is time I tried to establish myself at some court and remain safely behind stone walls of some castle. Travelling with you was a marvellous experience, but our ways part here and now.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_retirement_speech|We've had many battles and you've been kind to me, which I thank you for. But I feel my worthiness has been proven and I must now move on. I wish you well.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_retirement_speech|Commander, it's time for old Dick to spend well-earned coins and feast on our victories. It was great sightseeing around The Seven Kingdoms with you but people get tired after some time and so do I. Seek me out later, we'll drink t' our battles.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_retirement_speech|Captain, Xhondo wants to visit Summer Islands again before something happens to him. You must understand and not hold Xhondo.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_retirement_speech|Leader, I thank you for bringing me along but I'm afraid I can no longer stay in your service. I'll make my way home and try to start up some investments. Perhaps we'll see each other again.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_retirement_speech|Commander, I've had my share of glorious battles with you for now. It is time for Ser Creighton Longbough to regale his friends with stories and hear songs of my deeds. Maybe some king will make me lord of a castle? Who knows?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_retirement_speech|Chief, I hear a call inside me that I can't resist. I must respond to it and find peace. You have proved your worth to me on the field of battle and I shall seek you when I feel bloodthirsty again.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_retirement_speech|Captain, fighting alongside you was an honour, but I must take another road now. I'll drink to your health in my travels and if R'hllor allows, we'll see each other again.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_retirement_speech|My lord, There's something I want to tell you. I don't feel like I'm doing what I was meant to do fighting for you. Thank you for enlisting me but I just think my place is somewhere else.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_retirement_speech|I feel I must go out and explore the world on my own for a while.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_retirement_speech|The Lord of Light calls me. We must part ways I'm afraid.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_retirement_speech|I think I have gained enough experience with your company now. The banners are calling and I must go where I belong.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_retirement_speech|Wun-Wun not happy. Wun-Wun leave now.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_retirement_speech|Dongo must leave.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_retirement_speech|There are things I must do alone. I still have a score to settle with the Lannisters, perhaps we shall meet again.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_retirement_speech|A Stone must return to her Mountain. Keep the others safe, I hope to see you again.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_retirement_speech|I must seek another lord to serve. Perhaps another day we will seek blood and battle together.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_retirement_speech|Things are not going as well as I imagined, I must return home to help my people, perhaps we shall meet again under better circumstances.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_retirement_speech|It is time for me to return to the Iron Islands and take command of a ship and crew.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_retirement_speech|I must leave your side, I can no longer bring myself to harm another person.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_retirement_speech|{Father/Mother}, I feel I must go out and explore the world on my own for a while.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_retirement_speech|{Father/Mother}, I feel I must go out and explore the world on my own for a while.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_retirement_speech|I feel I must go out and explore the world on my own for a while.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_rehire_speech|It's good to see you again. I would very much like to re-join your cause.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_rehire_speech|Well well, look who it is. Have your pockets grown to allow enough gold to let me back where I belong?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_rehire_speech|Well, hello {ser/madame}! It is very good to see you again. I have not fared so well since we parted, maybe you would like your old pal back?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_rehire_speech|It's good to see you, Commander. Life of a smith isn't as glorious as one of a fighter. Perhaps you could use my services once again?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_rehire_speech|Greetings, Commander. It seems these old bones can still enjoy the heat of battle as I found out after some rest. Do you seek someone to make seasoned men out of your recruits?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_rehire_speech|Your grace. It seems my duties are to be here. Will you allow me to serve with you once again?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_rehire_speech|Sire! How glad I am to see you. I have understood that life at court is too tedious for me. Mayhaps you want me to tend to your sick and wounded once again?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_rehire_speech|Greetings to you, {playername}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_rehire_speech|It has been quite a while, Commander! But my pockets are close t' empty now. How about re-establishing our good old relations?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_rehire_speech|Xhondo is pleased to see this face again. No one left to rule your ship, so you seek Xhondo?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_rehire_speech|Well if it isn't my old glorious Leader! I managed to make a few investments but they will take some time to bear fruit. In the meantime I'm looking for work. Are you in need of my services?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_rehire_speech|Well met, Commander! The wars rage on but I've had little luck finding a lord that can afford my services. I know you to be well supplied with coin and so I offer you my sword once more.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_rehire_speech|My old Chief! I have found the peace I sought back in the Mountains of the Moon. But now I feel the lust for battle raising anew in me. Let me chop off the manhood of each of all your foes!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_rehire_speech|It's good to see your face again, captain! Have you run out of good archers and found me to fight together once again?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_rehire_speech|It's good to see you, my lord. I've reconsidered my options and I would like to join your retinue again.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_rehire_speech|It is good to see you again. I shall ride with you once again.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_rehire_speech|The Lord has sent me back to you {playername}. Perhaps we should join forces once again?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_rehire_speech|Will you allow me to serve with you once again?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_rehire_speech|Wun-Wun rejoin?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_rehire_speech|Dongo glad see master.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_rehire_speech|I will gladly return to your side, I have missed you my friend.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_rehire_speech|I have longed for this day. It is good to be back at your side.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_rehire_speech|A toast to success in future wars.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_rehire_speech|I have missed you. Hopefully things will work out better this time.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_rehire_speech|Lets down a few ales to celebrate our reuniting and hit the local brothel.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_rehire_speech|It is good to see you again. Perhaps you need me to take a look at your wounded men?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_rehire_speech|It is good to see you again {father/mother}. I shall ride with you once again.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_rehire_speech|It is good to see you again {father/mother}. I shall ride with you once again.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_rehire_speech|It is good to see you again. I shall ride with you once again.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_home_intro|We are very close to Braavos where I once lived and worked as the first sword of Braavos. The city's linked across a hundred islands, its a sight to behold. You should definitely pay a visit there soon if possible.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_home_intro|We're approaching Kings Landing. The capital of Westeros.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_home_intro|Can you smell that? No? Oh, umm me neither.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_home_intro|King's Landing. Never thought I'd see it again. Not after my trouble with the city watch anyways. Good place to live if you have the coin, but a living hell if you don't.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_home_intro|Stoney Sept... This place brings back enduring memories. Did I tell you that I had fought in the Battle of the Bells, one of the most important battles of Robert's Rebellion? It was fought here, in this town.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_home_intro|We are nearing Harvest Hall, the seat of House Selmy.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_home_intro|Do you know the story of this enormous castle, Harrenhal? Harren the Black, King of the Iron Islands and the Riverlands, built Harrenhal as a monument to himself, intending it to be the greatest of all castles in Westeros and for it to dwarf any other.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_home_intro|You wonder why they call me Brienne of Tarth?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_home_intro|Maidenpool, good place for a rest after a long walk on the road. It's the seat of House Mooton, with that chubby William Mooton and that red fish on his soldiers teats. The Stinking Goose is where you want to go to buy a room and get some food and other pleasures.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_home_intro|Oldtown is where Quhuru Mo left Xhondo. Xhondo knows some history. Oldtown survived the Andal invasion. City welcomed the Andals, not resisted them. Also, during the Great Spring Sickness Oldtown suffered badly. Only King's Landing suffered worse.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_home_intro|It has been some time since I came to Lannisport. I was actually here when the Ironborn burned the Lannister fleet during the Greyjoy Rebellion. I had come with my father to attend a wedding and ended up at a funeral.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_home_intro|Ah, Duskendale, I have friends here and many a good memories. Still, the place has a sad history to it as well. Have you ever heard of the Defiance of Duskendale? I am no bard, but I can tell you of it because I was there when it happened.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_home_intro|Mountains of the Moon have always been my true home. The Stone Crows, one of the tribes around here, are led by me. We did not recognize the authority of the Eyrie so these cravens outlawed us.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_home_intro|I grew up here, in Blackhaven. Did you know that when Ser Barristan Selmy was ten years old, he borrowed armour and entered a tourney as a mystery knight that took place here?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_home_intro|Golden Tooth. Never thought I'd see it again. I used to serve my lord here.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_home_intro|We are nearing Braavos {my lord/mylady}. A great many ships pass through here everyday. There is also the Bank of Braavos where we can borrow money for our next campaign.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_home_intro|We are nearing Myr. They call this here the fertile heel of Essos, an ancient Valyrian dragonroad.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_home_intro|We are nearing Bear Island, my home. They say that King Rodrick Stark won it in a wrestling match before granting it to House Mormont.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_home_intro|Thenn, home of the most advanced of the little people this side of wall.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_home_intro|Fist of First Man home of Tormund.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_home_intro|My family owed allegiance to the House of Darry. Lord Raymun Darry knighted me, he was a good man and his son Lyman was an honourable lad that rode atop my shoulders many times during feast.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_home_intro|Watch your step, do not forget I know this mountain better than anyone.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_home_intro|The first battle of Robert’s Rebellion took place here. Marq Grafton refused to answer Jon Arryn’s banner call, and called all those loyal to Aerys II Targaryn to join him in holding Gulltown.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_home_intro|She is a real bitch to climb ya know, 700 feet high all the way to the top.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_home_intro|Pyke has always been a tough nut to crack defensively. King Balon and his Brother Euron thought it impregnable.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_home_intro|I am at her side, it is Mother Rhoyne, how beautiful she is.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_home_intro|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_home_intro|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_home_intro|...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_home_description|well, it was once called the secret city and was unknown to the world for centuries. It was only really recognised after the doom of Valyria.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_home_description|Perhaps I should get myself some whores for the night, eh?!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_home_description|What in the Seven Hells is THAT?!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_home_description|City's divided by coin, you see; poorer folk lives in the slums of Flea Bottom and those that are rich live on the other side of Rhaenys's Hill or even by the Old Gate. Then you have merchant and work districts like the Street of Steel for smiths.{***};;;;;;;;
str_npc5_home_description|Forces of King Aerys were chasing after Robert Baratheon, attempting to cut him off from his northern allies. Robert was wounded and hiding here. Jon Connington took the town by force and began searching for him from house to house. Then Eddard Stark's and Hoster Tully's forces swept into the town. Connington fought back fiercely. Then Robert came out and led a counter attack.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_home_description|I grew up at Harvest Hall. The land round here is extremely arable and Harvest Hall produces more crops than most other regions in the Stormlands.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_home_description|The construction of his dream took about forty years. Upon its completion, King Harren boasted that his new fortress was impregnable, and it was. However, he failed to take into account Aegon the Conqueror and his dragons invading Westeros shortly after the building was finished.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_home_description|The island of Tarth, and there's Evanfall Hall.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_home_description|Town's got a harbour too, with ships coming and going even during the war. Bay of Crabs is nearby. This place is sorta my home away from home, being close to Crackclaw Point, you see. I like it here, though I cannot really explain the nature of my affection.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_home_description|A beautiful city. Also one of the most important ports. Trading ships from Westeros, Summer Islands, Free Cities and other places come here. Always a crowd in the harbours.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_home_description|But I would rather speak of the great works that take place here. All roads lead to Lannisport, and those roads are paved with gold! The Westerlands have a great abundance of gold mines, and Casterly Rock sits upon the largest lode. The city is not as large as King's landing but it has far less slums and far more business. The city watch is not as corrupt as the Gold Cloaks of King's Landing, and they are a good deal more reliable too.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_home_description|I was a squire back then, fetching swords and tending the horses. King Aerys had gone to Duskendale to settle the matter of town not paying taxes, but the Darklyns who ruled there took him prisoner. A great host was brought to the gates by the Hand, Tywin Lannister. But all those men were for naught, the Darklyns would open the King's throat the moment they attacked.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_home_description|We raid and plunder their villages, steal cattle and women, capture lordling's worth good ransom. We won't accept no rule over us. We're free people and we will live and die free. And no one dares attack us in OUR mountains, because they know we will kill them all to the last!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_home_description|He was eventually defeated and unmasked by Prince Duncan Targaryen. For that, Ser Barristan earned the nickname 'Bold'. Hard to believe, but that is true.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_home_description|Ser Lorimer. A skilled man, but not a wise one. He used to train me every morning. I thought I'd be a knight one day with his tutelage.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_home_description|I would advise you to pay the money back though {my lord/my lady}. How do you think I had become...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_home_description|This, is where I grew up. Famed for its arts and learning. Or if your like me, learning the arts of R'hllor.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_home_description|There’s a carving on our gate. A woman in a bearskin, with a child in one arm suckling at her breast. In the other hand, she holds a battleaxe.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_1_home_description|The Lannisters started this war by letting Ser Gregor Clegane ravage our lands. Then Ser Gregor killed our Lord Raymun Darry, who with Beric Dondarrion, tried to stop this rampage on orders of the King’s Hand, Ned Stark. Then Clegane killed his son Lyman Darry, an 8-year-old child, who refused to bend the knee to the Lannisters, destroying that noble house completely.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_home_description|This path was my prison, a convenient place where a single misstep or brigand could kill me. My father tried to bring me to King’s Landing after he was crowned, but Queen Cersei told him 'the city is not a healthy place for a growing girl.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_home_description|While Eddard Stark sailed to the North from the Fingers to call his banners, the Vale Knights loyal to Jon Arryn laid siege to the town and stormed the defences.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_npc4_home_description_2|Some unknown lord paid for my apprentice fees. I always wondered why.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_home_description_2|When Connington saw the battle was lost, he retreated in good order and was afterwards exiled for his failure by Aerys. The battle is called so because at the beginning of the it the sept tolled the city bells to warn the citizens of the battle and to persuade them to stay inside their houses.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_npc7_home_description_2|The dragons were not obstructed by high walls and forbidding towers, for dragons fly. They roasted Harren alive in the tallest of the towers, now known as the Kingspyre. Due to the extreme heat, the castle took on a charred, melted appearance.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_home_description_2|They call this place the Sapphire isle, though unfortunately not for the abundance of sapphires.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_home_description_2|Maidenpool has never seen no maidens in no bloody pools, though. It takes its name from the pool where the legendary Florian first spied Jonquil bathing with her sisters. Must've been a good sight, right?{***};;;;;;;;;

str_npc12_home_description_2|This went on until Barristan the Bold walked into the camp with the King in tow. He had single-handedly sneaked into the Dun Fort and saved Aerys.

str_npc1_kingsupport_1|That's a great idea, {ser/madame}. All the kingdoms are currently at war bringing hardship to everyone within the realm. Someone needs to bring honour back to these lands and theirs no reason it cannot be you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_kingsupport_1|Well, I'd support you. I think you'd give the people the kind of ruler which they have long needed.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_kingsupport_1|Well, Young One - I would worry for you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_kingsupport_1|Well, {playername}, you're a great leader and your valour in battle and mastery of command do deserve a throne.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_kingsupport_1|This feat has great a risk but yields a great reward if accomplished. If I accompany you, this is going to be my last significant deed, I wager. You have my support in this.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_kingsupport_1|I would gladly follow your grace. Though please take note of all the people I have served, the worst were those who played the game of thrones.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_kingsupport_1|Say no more. I can see it in your eyes that you are as certain of your success as a man can be. Perhaps this is a chance for me to do something in my life worth being remembered after my death.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_kingsupport_1|I would follow you wherever your Grace.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_kingsupport_1|Bloody business. That's what I think about it. Profitable, however, in the end. And with you being at the helm of your company this venture does have a chance of workin' out.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_kingsupport_1|This is troubling. Xhondo is not from this land, but Xhondo likes it here. Xhondo will help.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_kingsupport_1|A bid for the throne? That’s a gamble that would give even my late father pause. Anyone else I would've considered a madman or feverish, but in you I do see a potential investment.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_kingsupport_1|You will not stop until you become a King or lay dead in some godforsaken crypt, will you? That's the same I would do in your stead! Just imagine how famous we will become. Not that I lack fame, but there can't be too much of it, right?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_kingsupport_1|Well, Chief, you're the boldest little fighter I've met. Normally I just take what my strength allows me to take, but we have been through too many battles together for me to abandon you on this way.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_kingsupport_1|A throne, huh? Well, if we were just a brotherhood of knights seeking brigands and criminals, I would've called you a madman. But we have made ourselves quite a reputation. I'm with you, Captain.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_kingsupport_1|Well, my lord, you're a great leader and your valour in battle and mastery of command do deserve a throne.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_kingsupport_1|You saved me {my lord/my lady}. I will follow you as you please. I am sure you will make a fine {king/queen}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_kingsupport_1|The only King I ever formed a friendship with was Robert Baratheon, since we liked to drink, fight, and fornicate. I don’t think those things make a good king. But with you I have seen courage, a sense of justice, and the ability to fight the monster that the ravages of war often create.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_kingsupport_1|My family has declared fidelity to King Winter, Robb Stark. I believe in honouring the oaths and pledges of my family, I cannot be blind to my belief you can bring peace back to the land.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_dongo_kingsupport_1|Free Folk will follow {playername}, we like {playername}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_kingsupport_1|You have helped the people my family are sworn to protect. I gladly serve you for that deed alone.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_kingsupport_1|We both have dreams. I will support yours as you have supported mine.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_kingsupport_1|I pledged you my blade, if that is what you desire then I will cut a bloody swath through your enemies until they bend the knee or cease breathing. They will tremble at the mention of your name after I carve it into your enemies..{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_kingsupport_1|You pledged to help my people and I pledged to help you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_kingsupport_1|I will gladly tell all the Ironmen that they should support you in your cause.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_son_kingsupport_1|....{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_kingsupport_1|....{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_kingsupport_1|....{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_kingsupport_2|Of course. I can train your soldiers into great swordsmen. With swords as good as these by your side, who's to ever oppose you?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_kingsupport_2|As long as you shit gold and pass some my way, I'm all for it 'Your Grace'.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_kingsupport_2|I would, my {lord/lady}. But I would ask you to establish at least a minimal amount of erm.. agh crap.. what was I saying?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_kingsupport_2|I would, but you should give me your word that you will do your best to guard the innocents from monsters like Ser Gregor Clegane. Also, something needs to be done with prices on raw smithing materials.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_kingsupport_2|Definitely. But don't misunderstand me, Commander, I'm an old man and I want to have a warm and stout castle to spend my last days in, maybe even acquire a family and an heir to which I could hand down all my legacy.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_kingsupport_2|I would tell anyone who listens of your deeds on behalf of the weak and helpless, of your ability to lead men against great odds and triumph, and tell them that if you were to become {king/queen}, there would be one law and one peace.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_kingsupport_2|Yes, Sire. If we succeed in our venture though I would ask you to allow me to carry out my experiments on the dead and the living. I could use your prisoners for this.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_kingsupport_2|I would -- on one condition. You allow me a position in your Kingsguard.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_kingsupport_2|Make it worth my effort and time and I would. As long as there's good money in 't, I'm your most loyal follower and supporter in this affair.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_kingsupport_2|Yes. If you do not forget Xhondo later and reward him well.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_kingsupport_2|Without doubt. I know you to be a friend of merchants like me, and as {King/Queen} I am sure you would respect us and protect our rights to trade unimpeded.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_kingsupport_2|You ask me that after I've cut down myriads of people while fighting under your banner? There is just one simple favour I would ask of you when you become a King though - lands and glory for myself.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_kingsupport_2|Moreover, I'd chop off the manhood of each of the men that dare not support you! And Chief, I need your promise to make smallfolk let us take some livestock and goods from them from time to time.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_kingsupport_2|Certainly. You're a man of your word and a valiant warrior. I believe you will not let neither bandits nor highborn lords hurt the smallfolk. My initial quest was to bring justice so that's what I ask of you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_kingsupport_2|I would, but you should give me your word that you will do your best to guard the innocents from monsters like Ser Gregor Clegane. A good ruler is strong, but also honourable and just.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_kingsupport_2|I would. I would tell anyone who listens of your deeds on behalf of the weak and helpless, of your ability to lead men against great odds and triumph, and tell them that if you were to become {king/queen}, there would be one law and one peace.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_kingsupport_2|I must be true to the visions I see in the fire and that vision is you leading the people to a better world. I will consult with the Red Priest of R'hllor in Myr to grant you support.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_kingsupport_2|I am willing to cast aside prior allegiances and convince others to assist you in claiming the Iron Throne.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_kingsupport_2|Full bellies. You give that to Giants, we make you King.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_kingsupport_2|Dongo will tell all free folk that to be safe we need you to lead us.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_kingsupport_2|I have seen your valour and know your heart and for that I would be honoured to help you take the Iron Throne.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_kingsupport_2|I will go to the Vale and tell all nobles and commoners that you will protect the people and the realm, as I protected them on the path to the Eryie.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_kingsupport_2|I know many of the Knights of the Vale, most of which are upset about Lady Arryn not joining in this current war, even though honour demands it. We will find plenty of them willing to support your cause{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_kingsupport_2|You have shown yourself a resourceful warrior and leader. I would not throw you out of my bed or geld you, but I won’t bow to you. If you want an Iron Throne I will stand next to you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_kingsupport_2|Aye, I can see the lust for more in your eyes. You are more than willing to pay the “Iron Price” for the Iron Throne. If I help you, I expect to be named your Master of Ships. Why should I settle for a single ship if I am to be one of your sworn swords.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_kingsupport_2|I see the pain in your eyes as your men and your foes scream in agony from wounds. I know you want to heal the wounds of this land and bring peace.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_kingsupport_2|I would. I would tell anyone who listens of your deeds on behalf of the weak and helpless, of your ability to lead men against great odds and triumph, and tell them that if you were to become {king/queen}, there would be one law and one peace.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_kingsupport_2|I would. I would tell anyone who listens of your deeds on behalf of the weak and helpless, of your ability to lead men against great odds and triumph, and tell them that if you were to become {king/queen}, there would be one law and one peace.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_kingsupport_2|I would. I would tell anyone who listens of your deeds on behalf of the weak and helpless, of your ability to lead men against great odds and triumph, and tell them that if you were to become {king/queen}, there would be one law and one peace.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_kingsupport_2a|Please, go on.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_kingsupport_2a|Crown is gold and power. You will have a share of both.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_kingsupport_2a|I have no idea...{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_kingsupport_2a|I will do what I can.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_kingsupport_2a|You have deserved it and you shall have it.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_kingsupport_2a|That sounds very flattering coming from a knight such as yourself Barristan.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_kingsupport_2a|I don't think you will do me any harm by that.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_kingsupport_2a|That sounds fair.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_kingsupport_2a|There's so much money in it you won't be able to carry it all.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_kingsupport_2a|The {king/queen} will never forget Xhondo!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_kingsupport_2a|You have my word on that.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_kingsupport_2a|You shall rightfully have it. What do you have in mind?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_kingsupport_2a|I believe they can manage without some of it. Granted.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_kingsupport_2a|The realm will have justice. Please go on.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_kingsupport_2a|I will do what I can.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_kingsupport_2a|Please, go on.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_kingsupport_2a|Of course.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_kingsupport_2a|Excellent.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_kingsupport_2a|Your belly shall be full.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_kingsupport_2a|The support of the Free Folk would be welcomed.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_kingsupport_2a|Of course.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_kingsupport_2a|A good move indeed.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_kingsupport_2a|A great plan.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_kingsupport_2a|I guess I should be happy with that at least.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_kingsupport_2a|The Iron price is what I shall pay if it helps me achieve my goal.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_npc1_kingsupport_3|If I could go about this land for a few weeks. I have trained and worked with many great swordsmen. I shall let them know of you and your honour, they will be sure to join our cause.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_kingsupport_3|If you like, I can visit every brothel in Westeros and tell them the new {king/queen} will shit gold and enforce all whores to fuck for free. That should get you some support.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_kingsupport_3|PROTECTION! YES.. that's it.. protection. That's what I was saying. I shall find you more protection. How should I do that?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_kingsupport_3|Alright then. I shall meet with other smiths and tell them how life will improve with you on the throne. They will spread it across the realm and smiths will support you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_kingsupport_3|I did not doubt your honour even for an instant. I shall strive to find all the living knights, lordling's and lords I have ever fought with and convince them of your cause being worthy to join.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_kingsupport_3|Then I shall head out right away. I have made a lot of friends in high places over my years and I'm sure they would be willing to support your cause.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_kingsupport_3|Excellent. Then I shall use all my connections to spread the word about your claim all over the realm. People of great and humble births alike will hear that you are the only one worthy of being supported.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_kingsupport_3|Good! Then give me a few weeks and I'll go about the courts of this land, letting it be known that you are the one true {king/queen} of the Iron Throne.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_kingsupport_3|I believe I will, s'why I am here, after all. Days and weeks will pass and people all over The Seven Kingdoms will hear of you, drink to your health and dream of your ascension to the throne, you have my word on it.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_kingsupport_3|Good. Xhondo will find a way to let every sailor of this land know about greatness of {playername}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_kingsupport_3|If you promise to look out for the merchants and to make the roads safer then I will help you in your quest. I will meet with merchants, traders and guildsmen and speak of your claim. With their support, your right to the throne will be all the greater.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_kingsupport_3|Splendid, I knew you would understand my reasons for asking this of you. If I am to travel the land and spread tales of your valorous deeds, bringing knights and lordling's to your cause, I don't want to end up without any gratitude.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_kingsupport_3|I knew you would compromise with the mountain clans. How else are you to take the throne?! I'll let them know of your decision and you shall have the fiercest warriors in your host before long!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_kingsupport_3|Very well. Every peasant knows me as a former member of the Brotherhood Without Banners who shot criminals and other rabble on the roads. I will talk to them in villages and tell them of your just rule. You will have their support.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_kingsupport_3|Alright then. I shall meet with other squires and tell them how life will improve with you on the throne. They will spread it across the realm and young squires like myself will support you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_kingsupport_3|Very well {my lord/my lady}. Then I shall grab my gear and leave right away.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_kingsupport_3|Very well. I shall visit all the temples of the lord and seek your support.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_kingsupport_3|Very well, consider it done! I shall take my leave and rally the banners to support our new {king/queen}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_kingsupport_3|Then Wun Wun leave now to get support for more food.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_kingsupport_3|Dongo go see Free Folk. Dongo say {playername} is new king of all beyond the wall.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_kingsupport_3|Leave it to me and I will spread word of your deeds to every corner of the Riverlands and we will be one step closer to your goal.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_kingsupport_3|Very well. I shall make my way to the Vale and start spreading the word.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_kingsupport_3|Then I shall begin my mission right away and head into the heartlands of the Vale.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_kingsupport_3|Freefolk are not too big on bowing like Southerners, but I am certain I can convince many to take up your cause. Just don’t forget you must help us as well.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_kingsupport_3|So I shall spread the word of our new {king/queen} and gather supporters of your claim.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_kingsupport_3|I will seek out my fellow Orphans of the Greenblood, and tell them a new age is coming under your leadership.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_kingsupport_3|Very well {father/mother}. Then I shall grab my gear and leave right away.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_kingsupport_3|Very well {father/mother}. Then I shall grab my gear and leave right away.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_kingsupport_3|Very well {my lord/my lady}. Then I shall grab my gear and leave right away.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_kingsupport_objection|That loath can be seen and heard for miles. The sword of Braavos thinks you would be better off with him gone.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_kingsupport_objection|Your pissing in the wind with this one. You should have given his armour and horse to a warrior more fit for battles to come.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_kingsupport_objection|Nope! All hope is lost with that one!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_kingsupport_objection|Commander, that Summer Islander Xhondo you have entrusted with a task concerning your claim doesn't really give hope to me that he will be entirely honest with us while fulfilling it. I suggest keeping a close eye on him.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_kingsupport_objection|Commander, that soldier Nimble Dick you've sent on his quest is a slimy character. I know people like him, he'll be returning back with a purse full of golden dragons and an army to put us in chains till the rest of our days.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_kingsupport_objection|{My lord/My lady}, Bronn is no more than a sellsword, do you not think he will turn coat the moment someone offers him more coin than you do.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_kingsupport_objection|Sire, I know you have made common cause with that merchant, Hibald. I hardly believe his kind at all, he will more likely sell us to our enemies than acquire any support for our noble cause. Better send him on his way until it is too late.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_kingsupport_objection|I'm not so sure about that false knight, sire. He's dishonoured before and I'm sure he will do it again.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_kingsupport_objection|Commander, I have seen a lot of men good n' evil, but that former Maester you sent away with a task is the most dangerous man I've ever looked upon. He sends shivers down my spine with a glance. Better get rid of him.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_kingsupport_objection|Captain. Xhondo does not like trusting follower of Red God. Xhondo thinks those lunatics are capable of anything.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_kingsupport_objection|Leader, you've sent Gendry to the smiths to tell them how high you will value their work and how you will decrease the prices on materials thereby decreasing profit of merchants and traders all over the realm. That doesn't seem fair at all to me!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_kingsupport_objection|Commander, this sword for hire Bronn is a typical mercenary, a natural sellsword. I have seen enough of his kind in my life and I suggest you get rid of him, the sooner the better. Such people value gold more than allies.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_kingsupport_objection|Chief, that Ser Craven Longmouth that always speaks of how singers sing of him is worth nothing in a good battle. Don't you count on him to protect and support your claim. Just say the word and I'll chop his manhood off and feed it to the goats!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_kingsupport_objection|Captain, I heard that you had dispatched Shagga son of Dolf to the Mountains of the Moon to talk to other clans. You promised them that smallfolk would spare them some goods and livestock. I don't think that's just - fleecing poor peasants.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_kingsupport_objection|I'm sorry for speaking out but I just don't trust that man.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_kingsupport_objection|I have had my eye on someone for some time now. Let's just say I trust them less than the voices heard in the gusts of winter.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_kingsupport_objection|I do not trust that Brienne, sire. You should tell her to take her leave.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_kingsupport_objection|Mormonts have been hunting Wildlings for as long as I can remember. You mark yourself as an enemy of the Free Folk by sending him out in your name.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_kingsupport_objection|Little girl Mormont, fight good. Must crush niece of Crow King. Must protect free folk from her blade.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_kingsupport_objection|Dacey Mormont. Mormont, a name we fear and hate. The name of the Crow King, you make enemies of the free folk.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_kingsupport_objection|You could have sent a dozen rapist and killers with torches and accomplished the same thing. Qyburn will be forever stained as a member of the Brave Companions.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_kingsupport_objection|You just sent a criminal to praise your name and to ask for the people to support you. That tarnishes you and infuriates me.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_kingsupport_objection|You just sent the only person here that has to pay for protection to ask for support. You need warriors not merchants.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_kingsupport_objection|I doubt he will make it past the first tavern, Thoros is just a drunk and only cares where his next drink comes from.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_kingsupport_objection|You just sent little ole Dick to gain support. He should have been named Tiny. Don’t be surprised when people laugh at you for Tiny Dick.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_kingsupport_objection|I know you did what you thought was best by sending Mya to gather support. But she also has a claim to the Iron Throne. She may betray you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_kingsupport_objection|I have had my eye on someone for some time now. Let's just say I trust them less than the voices heard in the gusts of winter.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_kingsupport_objection|I have had my eye on someone for some time now. Let's just say I trust them less than the voices heard in the gusts of winter.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_kingsupport_objection|I have had my eye on someone for some time now. Let's just say I trust them less than the voices heard in the gusts of winter.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_intel_mission|Well, as it happens, I have a few cousins over in {s17} that can tell us about {s18}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_intel_mission|With a few gold coins the brothel in {s17} will tell me all I need to know about {s18}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_intel_mission|Although it has been a long time since I visited the countryside of {s17}, I still might be able to make contact with some of its older and wiser residents. They are retired merchants, rich farmers, and owners of big herds. They do talk a lot of bullshit, but may be able to tell us quite a bit about the state of the {s18}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_intel_mission|Commander, I could ask around the smithy over at {s17} of {s18}. Them peasants seem to know everything that happens in the realm so I believe we will have something to ponder upon when I return.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_intel_mission|Commander, an old veteran who is a big friend of mine lives in {s17}. I could visit him and drink to all the battles we've fought together and find out things you need to know about {s18}. Just say the word.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_intel_mission|If you need, I can go to {s17} and gain insight into {s18}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_intel_mission|Sire, if you let me travel to {s17} where I've spent many a day tending to the wounded locals I will gather all the information about {s18}. Once you save someone's life he is indebted to you. These people won't leave a single rumour out.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_intel_mission|If you need, I can go to {s17} and gain insight into {s18}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_intel_mission|Commander, information being one of my specialities there's no better source of it concerning {s18} than me. Give me leave to visit {s17} and after a while you'll have a bloody lot of latest news from it.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_intel_mission|Xhondo is brother to many other sailors in {s17}. They will speak. And with tales of {s18} Xhondo shall return.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_intel_mission|Leader, I do have certain ties with the guildsmen and merchants in {s17}. If you need to know about the political situation in {s18} I'm sure they'll have news to share with their old friend.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_intel_mission|Commander, if it's {s18} you want to know more of I could give you a hand in this. Many a noble man know me in {s17} and if you send me there, you will know everything on my return{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_intel_mission|Chief, send Shagga to {s17} where people tremble at the sight of me and they will bury me under heaps of rumours and news of {s18}. If they leave anything you need to know out I'll return to them and chop their manhoods off!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_intel_mission|Captain, if you need information about current state of affairs in {s18} I can talk with smallfolk at {s17}. They always shared their knowledge with the Brotherhood Without Banners, so they won't turn down my request.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_intel_mission|Commander, I could ask around the for information over at {s17} of {s18}. Them peasants seem to know everything that happens in the realm so I believe we will have something to ponder upon when I return.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_intel_mission|If you need {my lord/my lady}, I can go to {s17} and gain insight into {s18}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_thoros_intel_mission|I know several of the Red Priest in {s17}, through these brothers of the faith I can learn what is happening in {s18}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dacey_intel_mission|If you need, I can go to {s17} and gain insight into {s18}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_intel_mission|I talk to last giants and free folk of {s17}. We make little people bow, or we break them.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_intel_mission|Give all free folk and giants home South of Wall and I talk in {s17}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_intel_mission|House Grey is a small knightly house in the Riverlands, but we are highly respected from the roll we played in the Battle by the Lakeshore and Butcher’s Ball during the Dance of Dragons. I will have no trouble obtaining information about {s18} from the river lords.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_intel_mission|Every trader, nobleman, and commoner that has made the ascent to {s17} with me as their guide has always promised to help me whenever they could for protecting and guiding them. When I return from the Vale we should know a great deal more than we know today of {s18}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_intel_mission|I have friends in the House Templeton of the Ninestars, one of the great knightly houses of the Vale. They will certainly cooperate with any request I make of them.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_intel_mission|I will visit my brother-in-law Mance Rayder, he will gladly let me know what is going on beyond the wall.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_intel_mission|I know Captain Greyjoy, she is the only person I need to see to know which way the winds are blowing on the Iron Islands.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_intel_mission|I know many of the merchants of {s17} from trading spice and cloth to them with my family. These merchants will certainly provide us with some information about {s18}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_son_intel_mission|If you need {father/mother}, I can go to {s17} and gain insight into {s18}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_daughter_intel_mission|If you need {father/mother}, I can go to {s17} and gain insight into {s18}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_event_intel_mission|If you need {my lord/my lady}, I can go to {s17} and gain insight into {s18}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_fief_acceptance|Than I shall be lord of {s17}, it would be a great honour.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_fief_acceptance|{s17} as a fief? Well, I've always thought myself as a lord.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_fief_acceptance|Well well Young One, it is most generous of you to offer me {s17}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_fief_acceptance|Commander, I am just a smith, I wouldn't know how to rule {s17}. On the other hand... who else can be loved by smallfolk most if not one of low birth? One that was just like them? I thank you, Commander. I shall strive for my fief to prosper.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_fief_acceptance|That is honourable of you, Commander, to offer me {s17}. I shall accept it with due responsibility and strive to improve its state. Naturally, peasants of my fief will be trained by me to protect themselves and will make good recruits should you need them.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_fief_acceptance|Your House is growing strong {playername}. I shall be proud to accept {s17} as my own.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_fief_acceptance|Thank you, Sire, for granting me {s17}. This is a fine gift indeed! I always dreamed of having a land in possession. Now I shall strive to make it prosper to furthermore increase my incomes.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_fief_acceptance|Thank you your Grace. I shall defend {s17} in the name of your House.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_fief_acceptance|Now that's a reward I've been looking forward to! Dick Crabb, Lord o' {s17}, how does that sound? Soon golden dragons will flow to my pockets. Thank you, Commander, for this gift.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_fief_acceptance|Captain wants Xhondo looking over {s17}? Xhondo has no skill in this, it is not a ship to work on. But if Captain insists Xhondo will try.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_fief_acceptance|Are you offering me to hold {s17}, Leader? I accept your offer and rest assured I'll make it most profitable place in the whole realm. I can already see my investments bearing fruit. You won't regret your decision!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_fief_acceptance|Granting me {s17} is a rightful thing to do, Commander. I will not let you down, I swear it on my honour as a knight. This land will sing of my generous rule in a few months, no, in a few weeks!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_fief_acceptance|What a gift, Chief! Peasants in {s17} will worship Shagga son of Dolf as God of war soon enough! I'll train them to raid nearby villages and teach them how proper warriors fight!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_fief_acceptance|Me? Lord of {s17}? Captain, if that's not one of your jokes, I can tell you that I will protect the inhabitants of my fief to my last breath. I'll clear the surrounding lands of criminal scum and make this land peaceful and prosperous. Thank you for your faith in me, captain.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_fief_acceptance|My lord, you honour me with your offer. I shall be most useful to you and will hold {s17} in my name. I will strive to be the best and will always be your loyal servant. Farewell for now then, my lord.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_fief_acceptance|Our House is growing strong {my lord/my lady}. I shall be proud to accept {s17} as my own.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_dacey_fief_acceptance|Your House is growing strong {playername}. I shall be proud to accept {s17} as my own.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_wunwun_fief_acceptance|Wun-Wun happy.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_fief_acceptance|Dongo eats better now.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_fief_acceptance|I gratefully accept this great honour you have bestowed upon me. I will do my best to protect your subjects and bring them into prosperity.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_fief_acceptance|My dream has come true, I have overcome my bastard birth and become noble.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_fief_acceptance|Blood and battle have elevated me to lordship! I hope I can live up to your expectations.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_fief_acceptance|I will send a messenger to my people to tell them they will find a warm hearth in my lands, you have kept your promise.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_fief_acceptance|This is the greatest moment of my life! I would have been grateful for just a ship. I am going to turn these peasants into the toughest bastards in the land.. and the richest.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_fief_acceptance|I will watch over {s17} and in your name protect the people and bring them to prosperity.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_2_woman_to_woman|Men come and go. They lie, or die, or leave you. A mountain is not a man, though, and stone is a mountain's daughter. I trust my father, and I trust my mules. I won't fall.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_woman_to_woman|No matter where you come from a woman must do more to prove her worth. I have no doubt that you will become a legendary woman that all people will drink to for your heroic deeds.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_woman_to_woman|Let the men whisper behind your back all the nasty things their minds can conjure. We women will always get the last laugh when we show them that we know the quickest way to their hearts, a good sharp axe through the ribcage.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_woman_to_woman|Men think that a woman has no place on the battlefield, no place watching over the battlements of their own fief, or holding a throne. Take heart women such as Nymeria have proved them wrong just as you will. I think you will become even greater than her.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc1_turn_against|I'm sorry that we meet like this, {playername}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc2_turn_against|No offence {playername} but it turned out someone was paying a lot more than you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc3_turn_against|Oh {playername} -- what a tragic turn our lives have taken!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc4_turn_against|Well.... I'm not sure what to say. If we must fight, let's get it over with.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc5_turn_against|I'd rather meet with my worst and most feared enemy than with a man who once was my close friend, {playername}. It is a shame it came to this.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc6_turn_against|It grieves me more than anything I can say to meet you like this, {playername}. I shall not dwell on the circumstances that have led us to this point. I can only hope that we may one day be reconciled.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc7_turn_against|I am no warrior yet here I am, leading an army against you. I will honour our friendship and won't experiment on your body should I take you captive or find your corpse after battle's done.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc8_turn_against|So, we meet now as enemies, and may shortly face each other over the rims of our shields. A grim day this is.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc9_turn_against|Bloody Seven. Never thought to cross swords with you, {playername}. Let us end this fast.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc10_turn_against|Xhondo is not happy to fight {playername}. Forgive Xhondo.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc11_turn_against|By the Gods, I hoped this day would never come. The Seven have prepared a strange way for us to meet again, {playername}. Should I prevail, I will not feast on the victory.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc12_turn_against|Well met, {playername}. The circumstances of our meeting are rather unpleasant, but let us not waste our breath on words and let them sing of our glorious battle afterwards!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc13_turn_against|So now I get the chance to test my steel against yours, {playername}. Let us fight and the winner feast!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc14_turn_against|So that's how the Red God has seen fit to arrange our meeting. It pleasures me not at all to fight you, {playername}, but it seems we have no other choice. You must forgive me.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_npc15_turn_against|Well.. I'm not sure what to say. If we must fight, let's get it over with.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_kurleket_turn_against|It grieves me more than anything I can say to meet you like this, {my lord/my lady}. I shall not dwell on the circumstances that have led us to this point. I can only hope that we may one day be reconciled.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_wunwun_turn_against|Arrggghhhh!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_dongo_turn_against|Arrggghhhhh!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_1_turn_against|It gives me no pleasure to see you on the field of battle. Our past friendship will not slow my blade, I must do my duty, honour demands it.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_2_turn_against|I never thought I would be facing you in battle. I hope the gods spare you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_3_turn_against|Defeating you will bring me much glory and wealth. I hold no grudge against you, today you shall see the Mad Mouse Prevail!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_4_turn_against|I regret that our paths lead us here. Don’t worry about becoming a wight, I will burn your corpse.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_5_turn_against|I am glad to see you are still carrying my favourite weapon. I look forward to removing it from your corpse.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_6_turn_against|I know today the fields will flow with blood, many will be killed or wounded. This isn’t my desire, but I must do what I must.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_comment_intro_liege_affiliated|I am told that you are pledged to one of the usurpers who disputes my claim to the crown. But we may still talk.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_comment_intro_famous_liege|Your fame runs before you! Perhaps it is time that you sought a liege worthy of your valour.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_comment_intro_famous_martial|Your fame runs before you! Perhaps we shall test each other's valour in a tournament, or on the battlefield!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_comment_intro_famous_badtempered|I've heard of you. Well, I'm not one for bandying words, so if you have anything to say, out with it.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_comment_intro_famous_pitiless|I know your name. It strikes fear in men's hearts. That is good. Perhaps we should speak together, some time.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_comment_intro_famous_cunning|Ah, yes. At last we meet. You sound like a good {man/woman} to know. Let us speak together, from time to time.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_comment_intro_famous_sadistic|I know your name -- and from what I hear, I'll warrant that many a grieving widow knows too. But that is no concern of mine.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_comment_intro_famous_goodnatured|I've heard of you! It's very good to finally make your acquaintance.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_comment_intro_famous_upstanding|I know your name. They say you are a most valiant warrior. I can only hope that your honour and mercy matches your valour.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_comment_intro_noble_liege|I see that you carry a {nobleman's/noble's} banner, although I do not recognize the sigil. Know that I am always looking for good {men/warriors} to fight for me, once they prove themselves to be worthy of my trust.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_comment_intro_noble_martial|I see that you carry a nobleman's banner, but I do not recognize the sigil. No matter -- a brave {man's/warrior's} home is all the world, or so they say!{***};;;;;;;;;

str_unprovoked_attack_sadistic|I'm going to enjoy shitting down your throat after I've lobbed off your head. Does this sound appealing to you?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_unprovoked_attack_goodnatured|Why do you do this? We've got no quarrel, {ser/madame}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_unprovoked_attack_upstanding|I consider this an unprovoked assault, and will protest to your king. Why do you do this?{***};;;;;;;;;

str_lord_challenged_sadistic|You silly little {boy/girl}! I'll make you wish you'd never been born.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_lord_challenged_goodnatured|Very well. I had hoped that we might avoid coming to blows, but I see that have no choice.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_lord_challenged_upstanding|So be it. It saddens me that you cannot be made to see reason.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_lord_mission_failed_default|Well, I am disappointed, but I am sure that you will have many chances to redeem yourself.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_lord_mission_failed_quarrelsome|You failed? I should have expected as much from the likes of you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_lord_mission_failed_pitiless|You failed? Well. You disappoint me. That is a most unwise thing to do.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_lord_mission_failed_cunning|Well, I am disappointed, but no one can guarantee that the winds of fortune will always blow their way.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_lord_mission_failed_sadistic|Indeed? Those who fail me do not always live to regret it.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_lord_mission_failed_goodnatured|Oh well. It was a long shot, anyway. Thank you for making an effort.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_rebellion_dilemma_martial|{s45} was clearly wronged. Although I gave an oath to {s46}, it does not bind me to support him if he usurped his throne illegally.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_dilemma_quarrelsome|Hmm. {s46} has never given me my due, so I don't figure I owe him much. However, maybe {s45} will be no better, and {s46} has at least shown himself .{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_dilemma_pitiless|Hmm. {s45} says {reg3?she:he} is the rightful heir to the throne. That is good -- it absolves me of my oath to {s46}. But still I must weight my decision carefully.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_dilemma_cunning|Hmm. I gave an oath of homage to {s46}, yet the powerful are not bound by their oaths as our ordinary people. Our duty is to our own ability to rule, to impose order and prevent the war of all against all.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_dilemma_sadistic|Hmm. In this vile world, a wise man must think of himself, for no one else will. So -- what's in it for me?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_dilemma_goodnatured|I do not know what to say. I gave an oath to {s46} as the lawful ruler, but if he is not the lawful ruler, I don't know if I am still bound.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_dilemma_upstanding|This is troublesome. It is a grave thing to declare my homage to {s46} to be null and void, and dissolve the bonds which keep our land from sinking into anarchy. Yet I am also pledged to support the legitimacy of the succession, and {s45} also has a valid claim to the throne.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_martial|On the other hand, {s46} has led us in war and peace, and I am loathe to renounce my allegiance.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_quarrelsome|So tell me, why should I turn my back on the bastard I know, in favour of {reg3?a woman:the bastard} I don't know?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_pitiless|It is a most perilous position to be in, to be asked whom I would make {reg3?ruler:king} of this land. Yet it is also a time of opportunity, for me to reap the rewards that have always been my due!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_cunning|{s46} has been challenged, and thus he will never be able to rule as strongly as one whose claim has never been questioned. Yet if {s45} takes the throne by force, {reg3?she:he} will not be as strong as one who succeeded peacefully.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_sadistic|Perhaps if I join {s45} while {reg3?she:he} is still weak {reg3?she:he} will enrich me, but perhaps if I bring {s46} your head he will give me an even greater reward.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_goodnatured|{s46} has always treated me decently, yet it's true that he did wrong to {s45}. I hesitate to renounce my homage to {s46}, yet I also don't think it's right to support injustice.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_dilemma_2_upstanding|I feel that I must do whatever is best for the realm, to avoid it being laid waste by civil war and ravaged by its enemies.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_political_philosophy_martial|My sword is at the disposal of my rightful liege, so long as he upholds his duty to me.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_political_philosophy_quarrelsome|They're all a bunch of bastards. I try to make sure that the ones who wrong me learn to regret it.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_political_philosophy_pitiless|Men will always try to cheat others of their rightful due. In this faithless world, each must remain vigilant of his own rights.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_political_philosophy_cunning|Well, it's a harsh world, and it is our lot to face harsh choices. Sometimes one must serve a tyrant to keep the peace, but sometimes a bit of rebellion keeps the kings honest. Circumstance is all.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_political_philosophy_sadistic|It is better to be the wolf than the lamb.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_political_philosophy_goodnatured|Well, you should keep faith with your promises, and not do injustice to others. Sometimes it's hard to balance those. Stick with people you trust, I think, and it's hard to go far wrong.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_political_philosophy_upstanding|Kingship and Lordship have been instituted to keep the peace and prevent the war of all against all, yet that must not blind us to the possibility of injustice.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_political_philosophy_roguish|Hmm.. I guess I'm thinking that it's good to be a lord.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_rebellion_rival_martial|{s49} your ally {s44} once questioned my honour and my bravery. It's not often I get the chance to face him in battle, and make him retract his statement.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_rival_quarrelsome|{s49} you're working with {s44}. He's a crafty weasel, and I don't trust him one bit.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_rival_pitiless|{s49} you seem to have enlisted the support of {s44} -- who is soft, and weak, and not fit to govern a fief, and whom I have always detested.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_rival_cunning|{s49} {s44}, who has already joined you, is headstrong and quarrelsome, and a bit of liability.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_rival_sadistic|{s49} I have no desire to fight alongside your ally {s44}, who puts on such a nauseating display of virtue.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_rival_goodnatured|{s49} I'd be reluctant to be on the same side as {s44}, who has quite a reputation for cruelty.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_rival_upstanding|{s49} your ally {s44} is in my opinion a dangerous, unreliable, and highly unprincipled man.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_argument_favorable|I respect your line of argument{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_argument_neutral|I find your line of argument only moderately compelling{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_argument_unfavorable|I do not find your line of argument compelling{***};;;;;;;;;

str_but_comma_2|. Nonetheless, {***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_agree_martial|I have decided. I will back {s45} as the rightful heir.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_agree_quarrelsome|Ahh, I've thought long enough. I never did like {s46} much anyway. Let's go take his head from him.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_agree_pitiless|You are fortunate. I have decided to join you. Pray do not give me cause to regret this decision.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_agree_cunning|This is a most dangerous decision, but after careful consideration, I have decided that I will join you. Let's hope it is for the best.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_agree_sadistic|I have decided. I will back your {reg3?woman:man} {s45}. But you'd best make sure that {reg3?she:he} rewards me well!{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_agree_goodnatured|All right. I think your {reg3?woman:man} will be a good ruler. I'll join you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_agree_upstanding|So be it. My first duty is to this realm, and to save it from lawlessness I will back {s45} and renounce my homage to {s46}. May the Heavens forgive me if I do wrong.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_refuse_martial|I am sorry. {s45} has a good claim, but it's not enough for me to turn my back on {s46}. I will remain loyal to my liege.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_refuse_quarrelsome|Nah. Your whelp {s45} doesn't have what it takes to rule this realm. I'm sticking with {s46}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_refuse_pitiless|No. I will not join your rebellion. I count it little more than the tantrum of a child, denied a bauble which {reg3?she:he} thinks should be {reg3?hers:his}. I will stick with {s46}, whose ability to rule is well-tested.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_refuse_cunning|I am sorry. You do not give me reason for confidence that you will win. Many will die, but I do not wish to be among them. I will continue to back {s46}.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_refuse_sadistic|No. I won't play your little game. You grasp at a crown, but I think instead you'll get a quick trip to the scaffold, and I'll be there by {s46}'s side to watch the headsman's axe drop.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_refuse_goodnatured|I am sorry. I don't feel right turning my back on {s46}. No hard feelings when me meet on the battlefield.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_rebellion_refuse_upstanding|I am sorry. {s45}'s claim is not strong enough for me to inflict the curse of civil disorder on the poor wretches of this land. I will continue to back {s46}. May the Heavens forgive me if I do wrong.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_talk_later_martial|Now is not the time to talk politics! I am here today with my fellow lords, armed for battle. You'd better prepare to fight.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_talk_later_quarrelsome|Do you expect me to discuss betraying my liege with you, while we are surrounded by his army? What do you take me for, a bloody idiot?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_talk_later_pitiless|Still your tongue! Whatever I have to say on this matter, I will not say it here and now, while we are in the midst of our army.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_talk_later_cunning|This is hardly the time or the place for such a discussion. Perhaps we can discuss it at a later time and a different place, but for now we're still foes.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_talk_later_sadistic|You should have your mouth sewn shut! Can you imagine what would happen if the other vassals see me talking to you of treason?{***};;;;;;;;;
str_talk_later_goodnatured|So you wish to discuss your rebellion with me? Try that again when we aren't surrounded by my lieges army, and I will hear what you have to say.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_talk_later_upstanding|Whatever my thoughts on the legitimacy of the succession, I am not about to discuss them here and now. If we meet again when we can talk in privacy, I will hear what you have to say on the matter. But for now, consider me your enemy.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_changed_my_mind_pitiless|But when you plea like that, I will deign to reconsider.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_changed_my_mind_cunning|But you know, you're a well-spoken bastard. That impresses me. I'm still listening.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_changed_my_mind_sadistic|But as your silver tongue sings so pretty a song on your behalf, I will not dismiss the idea just yet.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_intro|Hello traveller, my name is Valarr Blackfyre, son of 'The monstrous' Maelys Blackfyre, the last of House Blackfyre.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_1|My father Maelys Blackfyre was once Captain of the Golden Company. He was killed in the Fifth Blackfyre Rebellion, and my mother, a Tyroshi noblewoman lost all her lands.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_2|Ya know, my Early life was spent learning languages, histories, and how to wield a sword and spear. I made my living fighting in the Golden Company where I rose to the rank of Lieutenant. That was when I met Jon Connington. He took an interest to me, and through him I learned my true past. I have since been travelling and gaining favour with those who would seek to help me gain the right of my father, and his father.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_swadian_rebellion_pretender_story_3|I am now ready and wish to overthrow the wicked Tyroshi masters and establish the new rightful home for House Blackfyre. I need your help to claim the Tyroshi lands as a launching point for future conquest... perhaps to the west... But no need to worry about that, yet.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_swadian_rebellion_monarch_response_1|Valarr Blackfyre and his dead father Maelys Blackfyre have no right to lands or title, his whore of a mother had little influence before her death, and she had no husband, her lands are now mine.{***};;;;;;;;;

str_feast_lengthy_description_1|The food you provided was insufficient for your guests and their retinues, forcing them to purchase their sustenance from the surrounding countryside at grossly inflated prices. The consensus among those who attended was that you failed to do your duty as a host, diminishing both their trust in you and your overall reputation.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_feast_lengthy_description_2|The food and drink you provided eventually ran out, forcing some guests to either buy their own from passing pedlars, or send some of their retinue home early. The more charitable attributed the shortfall to poor planning rather than meanness, but either way, it did your reputation no good.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_feast_lengthy_description_3|The food and drink you provided was adequate for your noble guests, although some of the commoners in their retinues went without. You are establishing a reputation as one who has at least a grasp of your social obligations as a noble.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_feast_lengthy_description_4|You have provided enough food and drink, and with sufficient varieties, to do yourself credit. The food, drink, and merriment have loosened your guests tongues, allowing them to converse candidly about the matters of the realm, and deepening their trust in you.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_feast_lengthy_description_5|You have provided a bountiful table not just for your noble guests but for their retinues, with food left over to be distributed to the poor. Your guests lavish praise upon you for your generosity, and for your understanding of the social obligations of your rank. The conversation, fuelled by the food and drink, has been merry, strengthening the bonds between those who attended.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_feast_lengthy_description_6|The realm will be speaking of the bounty of your table for months to come, and it will become the standard to which all other feasts will aspire. You have filled the bellies not just of your noble guests and their retinues, but also of the poor who flocked to the gates. {***};;;;;;;;;

str_quick_battle_troop_1|There is a reason no one goes about the cities without armed guards once the sun sets, and that reason is Rodrigo de Braganca. Once a bright eyed merchant who arrived at Tihr with a small fortune in rubies and a dream to corner the velvet market, he was soon reduced to a pauper, having lost everything to cutthroat competition with the colluding Rhodok merchant guilds. But he soon turned measuring scales into swords, and applied his considerable business smarts into building up the deadliest criminal enterprise in Veluca, with hideouts and operations in every major town. He has attained his goal, for the price on his head is greater than the riches he once pursued. Now he takes great pleasure in relieving his former competitors of their worldly goods -— and worries.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_quick_battle_troop_2|Usiatra usurped leadership of the group of bandits that occupied Siri, a rural village in the southern deserts outside the realm of Westeros and Essos, in a curt and bloody fashion when she was seventeen years old. Under her direction, the band of ruffians quickly expanded their operations across the southlands. Her shrewd, decisive manner, combined with her merciless ambition which she acts upon with inhuman composure and cruelty, garners fanatic admiration from those that follow her. As such, amongst her own she lives a decadent, spoilt lifestyle -- built upon the violent plundering she exacts in her travels. Her military strength and natural strategic wit allowed her outfit to remain undealt with in her homeland, and now she turns her eye towards the rich lands of Westeros and Essos to sustain her war band.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_quick_battle_troop_3|The second son of a minor noble living near Uxkhal, Hegen was educated in the art of war and single combat. After being knighted he served as a paid knight in the army of the lord of Uxkhal and fought against the Vaegirs before leading a group of outriders that defeated a Khergit raid near Amere. The ensuing counter raid and the following two campaigns earned him glory and fame as a warrior. Unfortunately, he lost any chance of further prestige when peace was declared and he was discharged. With no hope of inheriting and his skills at war languishing in peace, he assembled other young warriors and set out as a mercenary captain. He now hopes to take advantage of the fact that Westeros and Essos never lacks warring states in need of mercenaries.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_quick_battle_troop_4|Konrad is a professional mercenary from the distant land of Balion, far beyond the vast western ocean. Having spent most of his years on campaign and seen countless battles, Konrad has grown to love his life as a soldier of fortune. Though he once had his nose flattened by a mace blow and has received many wounds, he has nevertheless survived this harsh existence through the strength of his arm, innate cunning and pure luck. Hearing of the lucrative career opportunities awaiting a man of his talents in Westeros and Essos, Cedric chartered a vessel and crossed the sea with his men in search of new wars to fight in. A sellsword with no ties to any of the Westerosi states, he is more than happy to offer his services to any lord with a fat enough coin-purse.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_quick_battle_troop_5|Sverre is one of the so-called sea raiders -- freebooters and lawless men from the icy realm of Jumne beyond the North Sea, also said to be the ancestral home of the Nords. Already as a young man he has been along on many raids against both his distant cousins in the Wercheg region and the Vaegirs. However, Sverre was always a sharp lad, and it didn't take him long to see that Westeros was a far more prosperous land than his own, and that he could have a better life here than among his own people. During a raid on Jayek, Sverre stole away while his comrades were busy looting the village and taking captives. Passing himself off as a yokel from the Chalbek mountains, Sverre quickly built up a reputation for himself as a fierce fighter, and he now seeks his fortune at the head of a mercenary band.{***};;;;;;;;;

For all of his life he has tracked the beasts of the wild for their meat and fur, living off the land just as his forefathers had done in happier days, before the endless wars. Now, the game is quick to take fright from the constant sounds of battle, and the wanton slaughter of animals by soldiers has left empty those forests that have not been burnt down. Facing starvation, Borislav chose to turn his great skill with bow and spear, learned from hunting stag, wolf, and bear, to the practice of hunting men, and his steady hand and keen eye have claimed many lives. Borislav does not care much for the disputes of kingdoms, and is only really interested in keeping himself and his men fed.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_quick_battle_troop_7|Stavros was born in the independent city-state of Zendar, and spent much of his adult life serving in the town watch under the famous constable Hareck. Stavros' leadership and prowess were instrumental in ridding the area of the dreaded river pirates, but even he was powerless against the calamity that befell the city. When Zendar was razed to the ground by a great horde of sea raiders, Stavros fled the burning city in a crowd of refugees. After a brief period of wandering and odd jobs, he found a place in a mercenary company, eventually rising to become its leader due to his dedication and tactical aptitude. He now devotes most of his efforts to working with manhunters and local authorities against the sea raiders and other outlaws, trying to keep the land safe for travelers.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_quick_battle_troop_8|Growing up with one of the nomadic tribes deep in the desert beyond Sarranid lands, Gamara learned early on how to hunt with sling and spear. However, the simple life and pitiless conditions in the desert did not satisfy her, and she burned with a desire to see the great world beyond that she had heard so many wondrous tales about. Life is not easy for an adventuring young woman, and Gamara had to learn the ways of Westeros quickly. Taking the weapons and armor of a soldier who had attacked her after a dispute, Gamara now hides her beauty under thick Sarranid garb, and many never even suspect she is a woman –- certainly as a force on the battlefield she is as dangerous as any man. She has gathered about her a group of followers, and together they wander the war-torn land in search of glory.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_quick_battle_troop_9|Aethrod is not a noble person. He's changed his name twice, and is blamed for most of the crimes on Vaegir territory. True or not, he claims to never have taken an innocent man's life, and considers himself a patriotic citizen, several times bringing his band or renegades to the assistance of his faction, when it is threatened. In times of peace, however, most lords must be careful when he is in the vicinity due to his daring personality and willingness to challenge a lord. Born and rasied in the slums of Reyvadin, he learned how to use a bow at an early age and ran away from home a fourteen. Now at thirty two, his archery skills are near perfect and though he can't ride a horse well, he can hit one at the furthest of distances. Tough as nails and sharp as a hawk, he is a true local legend.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_quick_battle_troop_10|Being the daughter of one of the most infamous bandit leaders in the Sarranid realm isn't always easy, but Zaira seems to have managed quite well. Unlike most women she grew up learning the ways of the desert warrior and is deadly with the sword as well as the bow. While the other girls her age learned how to manage the household, Zaira learned how to best gut a merchant before taking his money. At the age of sixteen Zaira had killed more men than the average veteran in the Sultan's army. Just before her twentieth brithday her father was killed in brawl with another bandit leader. As the only child, Zaira now took control of her father's band. After avenging her father, she quickly picked up where he had left. Now she's on a good way of establishing her own reputation has a bandit leader.{***};;;;;;;;;
str_quick_battle_troop_11|Argo Sendnar had quite a diversified life. When he arrived at Westeros, working as a trader, he hoped for more income than in Lokti. Little did he know, that the wartorn Westeros was a wasps' nest for bandits and cutthroats that made trading a lot more complicated than in Lokti. Being bought out by another competeting trader, after losing all his goods and money due to caravan raids, he was forced to serve as a caravan guard to make a living. Despite his pathetic fighting skills, he soon found an employment on one of the more dangerous routes through Westeros and Essos. Due to sheer luck he managed to stay alive long enough to aquire enough combat experience and money to start his own buisness as a caravan master, offering his services to traders in need of defense for their goods.{***};;;;;;;;;

Sometimes your masters didn't give you any food so you learnt how to forage food from the nature to quell hunger. Your world was small and monotonous, where days were all the same. Rain and sun punished you in the long hours of slavering and your back ached from so much work, but you managed to live on. The cold took animals and people alike, but you always lived to see another dawn, though some of your fellow-sufferers were not as fortunate. When you had some free time, although that happened very rarely, it was spent with practising throwing rocks with a simple sling.^^{***};;;;;;;;;

Your skills in martial arts were noticed by your local lord who was impressed to see a woman so well versed in handling weapons. He hired you to form a part of his retinue. You learned the power systems and struggles of the Westerosi folk who lay claim to the land, and how best to achieve such a living for yourself. Your lord saw to it you were trained in the most effective formations and how to best keep rabble in order, as much for his own sake as for yours. Weapon sparring was done almost on a daily basis and you could say you felt as one with a plethora of different one-handed, two-handed and polearm weapons. When raids were successful there was plenty of loot to be divided amongst the warriors. You witnessed first-hand the brutal and often deceptive ways in which power was won, also by listening to the songs and poems sung in the warm halls. Old heroes like Azor Ahai and the Last Hero were all but a heroic cry from a distant past. The time was ripe for a new hero to emerge.:Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a man, and the whole world seemed to change around you.

You set out on your own with nothing except the instrument slung over your back and your own voice. It was a poor existence, with many a hungry night when people failed to appreciate your exhibition, but you managed to survive on your music alone. As the years went by you became adept at playing to drunken crowds in numerous taverns. You became very well versed in talking anyone out of anything you wanted.^^{***};;;;;;;;;

Being a wife to a free men meant you had it laid down easier then wives of other lower ranking peasants who had to do all the tasks by themselves. You owned some servants who helped you with the hard work, but since your husband didn't own a lot of land you still had to do variety of tasks all peasants wives have to do. Your husband had to pay rent to his overlord and owed him labour services in exchange for the given land. When he was involved in war your husband answered his call as a foot soldier where he had to rely on his shield and a spear in the thick of battle. He often taught you how to fight and defend yourself in case he wasn't home in times of need. Hunting in the woods alone with your bow was your favourite activity and it helped bring additional food to the table. When no animals were to be found in the forest you looked for edible plants which you then cooked for the whole family. You spent a lot of time out in nature searching for special herbs that can heal wounds and the sick. :Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a man, and the whole world seemed to change around you.

str_story_job_peddler|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg11?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. Heeding the call of the open road, you travelled from village to village buying and selling what you could. It was not a rich existence, but you became a master at haggling even the most miserly elders into giving you a good price. Soon, you knew you would be well-placed to start your own trading empire...^^{***};;;;;;;;;
str_story_job_craftsman|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg11?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. Being a craftsman you specialised as a smith, crafting tools and weapons of function and beauty out of minerals. Sometimes you were used as an engineer by a local lord when a bridge or a fortification needed to be built, this also shone through your carpentry skills. All the created weapons had to be tested by you, so wielding one handed weapons, two handed weapons and also polearms felt very natural to you. As time wore on you became a master of your trade, and fine work started to fetch fine prices.

Dissatisfied with common men's desperate scrabble for coin, you took to your local lord's own forests and decided to help yourself to its bounty, laws be damned. You hunted stags, boars and geese and sold the precious meat under the table. You cut down trees right under the watchmen's noses and turned them into firewood that warmed many freezing homes during winter. All for a few silvers and a bit of an honour loss, of course. When times were tough you foraged for food and got proficient in finding edible plants in the wild.^^{***};;;;;;;;;
str_story_job_preacher|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg11?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. When not working or studying in the Sept you packed your few belongings and went out into the world to spread the word of God. You preached to anyone who would listen, and impressed many with the passion of your sermons. Though you had taken a vow to remain in poverty through your itinerant years, you never lacked food, drink or shelter; the hospitality of the peasantry was always generous to a rising {reg11?woman:man} of God. Now and then locals would visit the Sept to purchase products made there. You were the one who sold the items to them. Another thing at which you really excelled at was healing injured and sick people. Many broken bones got healed, many souls remained in the bodies instead of venturing into God's hands. Carrying a staff and a bag of rocks made you feel safe in times when you were out of the Sept spreading the world of God.^^{***};;;;;;;;
