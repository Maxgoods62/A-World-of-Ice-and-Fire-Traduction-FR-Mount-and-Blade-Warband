ip_morale|Morale{***}
ip_morale_text|Morale represents the ability and willingness of the troops in a party to summon up the endurance, bravery, and discipline they need to face the stresses of battle and the march. It is not the same thing as the troops' happiness. Elite troops may grumble and whine about the hardships of campaigning -- but then stand together as one when the arrows start to fly. On the other hand, a commander who gives his men everything they want may find that they grow soft, and waiver before the enemy's charge.^^ Morale's greatest impact is on a party's behaviour in battle, determining how aggressively troops engage the enemy, and how likely they are to break and run if they perceive the tide of battle turning against them. Morale also affects a party's march speed, as a less motivated party will move more slowly, as the men are not pushing themselves to their physical limit, and pause more frequently, as it waits for stragglers to catch up. Finally, a party with very low morale will start to suffer desertions.^^ Some factors that affect morale are intuitive. For example, a charismatic commander with a reputation for winning battles can infuse his or her men with a sense of confidence. Leaders who give their men well ample and varied supplies of food, and pay them on time, demonstrate that they care about their troops' welfare, and are less likely to lead them into disaster.^^ Other factors are less intuitive -- particularly those related to a party's sense of group cohesion. In a small tight-knit party, for example, men will often fight hard against daunting odds to avoid showing cowardice before their comrades-in-arms. A large party on the other hand may see its cohesion strained, as the commander has less time to supervise the men, listen to their grievances, and resolve their disputes. Frequent battles will strengthen the bonds between men, while long periods without combat will see the troops become bored and quarrelsome.^^ The morale report, accessibly by hitting the 'reports' button will give the player a sense of the factors affecting his or her men's morale.{***}
ip_economy|Economy{***}
ip_economy_text|Towns and villages in Westeros and Essos need a wide variety of goods for their populations to remain healthy and productive. First in importance is food. Grain is the staple crop of Westeros and Essos, but people also need fat and protein in the form of meat, fish, or cheese. It takes almost as much work to preserve meat as to produce it in the first place, so salt is also in high demand. After food comes clothing: heavy wool, lighter linens, or luxurious velvet. Finally, people need the tools of their trade: ironware, pottery, leather-ware, and, of course, arms, armour, and horses for war.^^Most agricultural products are produced in the villages, while artisans in the towns specialize in manufactured or artisan goods like fabrics or ironware. Also, different resources can be found in different parts of the country. Consequently, the key to prosperity in Westeros and Essos is trade -- both between the villages and the towns, and between the major towns themselves.^^When trade flows, goods will be available and affordable, the population of a centre will be healthy and energetic, and migrants will flock from the nearby regions. The centre will produce more, consume more, and be able to contribute more in taxes to their lords. When trade dries up, towns and villages will see their workers flee to seek work elsewhere, and economic activity will drift to a stand-still. Thus, it is in the interests of rulers to protect trade routes from the hazards of war and banditry. A smart merchant, however, may want to seek out towns which have become isolated from the rest of the land, as he or she may be able to turn a tidy profit from the resulting price imbalances.^^Because villagers usually plan to take their goods to market in towns, village markets will be rather quiet places, and villagers will buy cheap and sell dear. Serious merchants will stick to the towns to make a profit, although some parties may decide to make a quick stop in a village to acquire supplies.^^A player who wants to know about the factors affecting a region's prosperity can speak to the guildmaster of the local town. Other information can be gleaned from passers-by, although they might not know very much outside of their own particular trade.{***}
ip_courtship|Courtship{***}
ip_courtship_text|You may wish to marry into one of Westeros and Essos' noble families. Marriage is not necessary for someone to rise in power and stature, but it does provide them with an opportunity to improve their relation with lords and establish a claim to the throne.^^Marriage requirements will be different for males and females. A male character will usually need to pursue a traditional path of courtship. He should establish a reputation in aristocratic society, get on good terms with his bride's parents or guardians, and then woo the lady according to local custom. If a player grows impatient, he may attempt to take a short cut -- but there will be consequences in his relations with other lords.^^A male character should keep in mind that other lords will be competing with him for the affections of the kingdom's ladies. Also, a lady's tastes are unpredictable, and a player may also find that the object of his love does not love him in return. Romance, in Westeros and Essos as elsewhere, does not always prosper. Of course, a player may resort to other, less gentlemanly means of winning a lady's heart, but again, that will have a serious impact on his reputation.^^To get started on the path of courtship, a male player should try to get involved in the social life of aristocracy, attending feasts and tournaments. Also, wandering troubadours and poets can serve as a useful repository of information on courtship, and keep the player up to date about the latest gossip.^^Female characters can also marry -- but they should keep in mind that Westerosi society is very traditional, and, as adventurers, they have chosen a very unconventional path for a woman. A female character may have to look for a while to find a lord who is open-minded enough to marry her.^^On the bright side, a female character does not have to go through the elaborate rituals of courtship, and she also may gain more from a marriage than her male counterpart. For a woman adventurer, marriage can be a quick path to power -- and an unscrupulous character may be able to use her husband as a tool of her political ambitions.{***}
ip_politics|Politics{***}
ip_politics_text|The continents of Westeros and Essos, although they represent different cultures, all adhere to the same basic political system: feudalism. Feudalism is based on the relationships between individuals: the oaths of loyalty given by a vassal to his or her liege. In exchange for this oath, the vassal will usually receive a fief, a parcel of land whose income will be used by the vassal to raise troops to support the liege in time of war. A liege also has an obligation to protect his vassals, and to treat them justly.^^This is how it works in theory, anyway. In practice, vassals will not always work in their factions' interests, particular as they are often quarrelling with one another. Nobles have different personalities, and sometimes those personalities clash. Or, perhaps two nobles were once friends, but fell out over in the aftermath of a setback or a defeat -- or because they both were wooing the same lady. Jealousies will also surface as they vie for the favour of the king -- perhaps over newly conquered lands, or over who will be given the coveted office of marshal, the lord in charge of organizing large-scale campaigns.^^When one realm in Westeros and Essos makes war on another, the political unity of the each kingdom is as important as the quality or number of its soldiers in determining the outcome. In a cohesive kingdom, nobles will join together in a large force to sweep their opponents before them. In a kingdom divided by petty quarrels, lords will fail to respond to the marshal's summons, or drift away to attend to their own business if a campaign is not going well. A faction's political cohesion will also impact warfare when campaigns are not in progress. In a divided faction, lords will be less likely to join together on raids and patrols, and come to each other's defence.^^If it seems self-defeating for nobles to bicker and quarrel when the enemy is just over the horizon, keep this in mind -- ultimately, a nobles loyalty goes not to a particular faction or culture, but to himself and to his family. If a noble fears that his faction is collapsing, or if he is being neglected by his liege, he can usually find a reason to withdraw his oath of allegiance, and change sides. Players should keep this in mind, as they may find that there are opportunities to turn discontented former enemies into allies.{***}
ip_character_backgrounds|Character Backgrounds{***}
ip_character_backgrounds_text|A player character in Westeros and Essos may choose to come from a variety of social backgrounds. This choice will affect not just his or her starting skills and equipment, but also the course of his or her career as an adventurer.^^War and politics in Westeros and Essos are traditionally dominated by male aristocrats. A nobleman player character may find that he is invited into this 'old boys' club' fairly quickly, but women and commoners may face a few extra hurdles on the way. If you choose to start the game as a male nobleman, you can think of it as the 'easy' setting. Starting as a noblewoman or a male commoner is somewhat more difficult, and starting as a female commoner is probably the most challenging way to begin a game.^^However, women have some starting advantages. Simply by taking up arms, a female warrior will draw attention to herself, and she may find that she can build up her reputation faster than a male. Also, it is traditionally easier for a woman to marry up the social ladder than it is for a man, and a woman may find she can gain more from a strategic marital alliance than her male counterpart.^^Finally, keep in mind that the game does not place any limits on the upward mobility of characters based on their background. Noble or common, male or female, married or unmarried -- anyone can rise to become ruler of all Westeros and Essos, if they are sufficiently brave, lucky, or resourceful.{***}
ip_military_campaigns|Military Campaigns{***}
ip_military_campaigns_text|When kingdoms in Westeros and Essos go to war, their armies have two basic offensive options. They can try to attack villages and lay waste to the countryside, damaging their enemy's prestige and economy. Or, they can try to seize and hold castles or towns, taking territory This second option can involve long, bloody sieges, but will yield more decisive results.^^It is important to note that the realms of Westeros and most of Essos do not field standing armies, which remain in the field as long as the ruler desires. Rather, these realms are protected by feudal levies comprised of the major nobles and their individual retinues.  Sometimes, these nobles launch their own private attacks into enemy territory, but the most decisive events will usually take place when the great hosts are assembled. The kingdom's marshal, a noble appointed by the king, will summon the host before the campaign and lead them out to battle. However, he should be careful not to keep them in the field too long. Otherwise, the host will begin to disintegrate, as the vassals drift off to pursue their own business, and the army will be vulnerable to a counter-attack.^^For this reason, the rhythm of wars in Westeros and Essos often resemble the rhythm of a duel between two individual combatants. One side will gather its strength and seek to land a blow against the enemy's territory. If the marshal spends too little time gathering the vassals, he may not be able to do any real damage. If he spends too much time, then the campaign may end before it has even begun. A large realm will have an advantage over a smaller one, just as a brawny combatant has an edge over a smaller foe, but a realm's political cohesion can also be a factor, just as a fighter with great stamina can outlast her opponent. Sometimes, the armies of two realms will meet head on, resulting in a major battle in which both numbers and morale will decide the outcome.^^Kingdoms will have imperfect intelligence about their enemies. Attacking lords will need to frequently scout enemy territory to determine which fortresses may be vulnerable. An army defending its homeland will benefit from the alarms raised by castles and towns, which broadcast intelligence about enemy movements in the area. Such intelligence will be imprecise, however, particularly when it comes to numbers. A defending force which sets out to raise a siege or rescue a village may be able to overwhelm an unprepared attacker -- or it may miscalculate, and find that it is the one to be overwhelmed. Attackers, in turn, must be careful how far they advance into enemy territory, with aggressive marshals venturing further than cautious ones.^^Players will be expected to join in their faction's military campaign, either by joining the host, or by scouting ahead into enemy territory. Some players may find that their realm's marshal is too cautious, or too aggressive, for their tastes. In this case, they can intrigue with other lords to try to replace the marshal, or build support to become the marshal themselves.^^Most wars are of limited duration. A king who goes to war will, for the sake of honour, feel obligated to pursue the conflict for a short while. However, unless he is soundly beating his enemy. he may soon start looking for a way out of the conflict, lest he leave himself vulnerable to an attack by a third party. Westeros and Essos rulers are keenly aware that today's ally may be tomorrow's enemy, and vice versa.{***}
ip_prisioner_system|Prisoner System{***}
ip_prisioner_system_text|The skill 'prisoner management' has been removed from A World of Ice and Fire, as it seems unrealistic to manage the number of prisoners in terms of a skill. In A World of Ice and Fire the number of prisoners that the player can have depends on the size of his/her army. That is, the more troops able to keep guard, the more prisoners it can carry.{***}
ip_ambush|Ambush{***}
ip_ambush_text|The ambushing skill allows you to set up ambushes. From the camp game menu, choose to set up an ambush. You will be told the current nature of your ambush, and if you are attacked,^ you will have the choice to launch the ambush. Ambushes can have devastating positive or negative effects.{***}
ip_sneaking|Sneaking{***}
ip_sneaking_text|The sneaking skill allows you to sneak. From the camp game menu, choose to sneak. Sneaking will reduce your speed.^ However, if you are the attacker, you might have, according to you sneaking check, some combat bonus (but not as great as you would have for an ambush).{***}
ip_entrenchment|Camp Entrenchment{***}
ip_entrenchment_text|When your army sets up camp for the night, you are given the option to entrench your camp site. An entrenched camp site is a temporarily fortified position using terrain and pickets as a defensive barrier. Armies composed mostly of cavalry units will get little benefit from entrenching. Armies comprised mostly of foot soldiers will find that entrenchment will give them a significant advantage over cavalry units. Soldiers very much dislike digging holes and planting pickets, so you will suffer a small morale penalty when choosing this option.^^ If you choose not to entrench your camp site, you will be at a disadvantage if attacked while camping. Your camp may be over run and plundered. Items in your inventory may be looted or destroyed in the battle. An entrenchment that has not been over run receives the benefit of multiple ammunition reloads for the troops. A normal camp site gets no such benefit.^^  In order to entrench your position you will need tools, time, and skill. Tools can be purchased at many of the towns within the Known World, and one set must be in your inventory in order to entrench. The time required to entrench is based upon the number of soldiers in your army and your parties skill in engineering. A small band of warriors with no skill in engineering will take days to entrench a camp site. An army of 30 or more with a few points in engineering can accomplish this in just a few hours.^^ When you complete the entrenchment, a circle of pickets will surround your camp. This entrenchment will remain in place for approximately three days after leaving the entrenchment. You can leave and return to the entrenchment during this time without having to do any more digging or planting of pickets, thus avoiding any morale penalty. This makes an entrenched site an excellent base of operations for sieges or incursions into enemy territory.{***}
ip_siege_warfare|Siege Warfare{***}
ip_siege_warfare_text| One of the things missed in Warband was completely realistic siege warfare. A World of Ice and Fire exploits this to the fullest. Now when the player besieges a settlement two paths can be taken to subjugate the place: by debilitation (hunger, diseases ...) and by assault.^^In the first case, the player's mission is to encircle the settlement (you need 200 or more men) and prevent it from receiving supplies or reinforcements. At the same time various actions can be performed to undermine morale, spread disease or destroy food reserves of the settlement. This type of action will take longer, but also prevent a large number of casualties.^^In the second case direct action is taken, provided assault equipment is available (ladders, battering ram, ramps, mantlets ...) or offensive actions (wearing down the defenders, burning their houses and walls ...). This is when the player feels ready to launch a full-scale assault to conquer the settlement. This type of action has the advantage that the place can be vanquished in a short amount of time, but usually at a very high cost of lives.^^In addition to the above, a new system of assault involving both types of siege tactics is also available. When the settlement has a port, the player may equip a fleet and block the port. The player can then choose to continue the siege until the surrender by debilitation, or lead an assault by sea.^^The complexity and characteristics of the new siege system is long, and the best thing is to discover and develop strategies for yourself. Welcome to Realistic Siege Warfare.{***}
ip_sea_travel|Sea Travel{***}
ip_sea_travel_text|Ferries at various harbours on the world map transport your party between two stations. While this is cheap when your party is small, it becomes more expensive with party size.^^To travel longer distances on the sea, one may travel from one port town to another. This can be initiated from the town menu or by talking to the shipwright in the port part of the town scene. Similar to ferries, this service becomes more expensive with party size.^^Once you have your own ship, you may embark from the port it is in by clicking on 'Sail from port' in the town menu. You will return to the map, but this time at sea on your ship. Sea travel then works much like land travel.^^There are two different ways to get back on land. You can either click on a port or use a landing point. To find a landing point, travel closely along the coast or right click on your party and select 'find closest landing point.' As with ports, click on the landing point to disembark. In either case, your ships will remain at the position where you landed.^^If your party's size is greater than the capacity of your ships, you won't be able to embark. In this case, you can establish troop quarters (Camp menu) at your current position and another troop quarters at your target position, then transport your army step by step between both quarters.^^When travelling by sea on the campaign map, you can always check the current weather. After clicking on the 'Camp' button, current conditions are shown on the left side. If the weather conditions change, you will be notified by a message in the lower left corner of the screen.^^On the one hand, windy weather is good for the speed of your ships on the campaign map and in sea battles. On the other hand, the chance that it will damage your ships also increases. Damage worsens the condition of a ship, slowing it or even destroying when the condition reaches 'Dangerous.' You may check the conditions of your ships by clicking on 'Camp' and then on 'Fleet.'^^Finally, the weather also determines the behaviour of ships in battle. This can always be checked beforehand by clicking 'Camp' and then on 'Check location.'^^Sea travel is dangerous and can lower the morale of your troops. When this happens, you will be notified by a message. Troops especially dislike spending the night on the water. Therefore, consider plotting your route to make landfall by night. If morale on the sea gets too low, troops may mutiny. This ca be somewhat reversed if the player chooses Ironborn as his culture when he created his character.^^Some troops like Sailors and certain Ironborn troops are experienced seamen and will increase the travel speed of your ships on the campaign map. You can check the effect on the left side of the camp menu.^^If there is more than one ship in your fleet, the speed of the fleet is determined by its slowest ship. However, as soon as you have more than one ship in your fleet, you can split the fleet. To do so, travel close to a shore. Then click on 'Camp', 'Fleet' and finally on 'Leave ship at shore' to leave the slower ship(s) there. To bring ships together again, one needs to bring them all to a port. To get a overview of all your ships at their location, click on 'Character' and then on 'Ships.'{***}
ip_sea_battle|Sea Battle{***}
ip_sea_battle_text|At some point after starting to travel on the sea, you will participate in a naval battle.^^First of all, you need to know how to control your ship. You can give the command to row forward, fast forward, backwards, or stay. The up and down arrow keys switch between these commands. You can also give the command to go straight, starboard, hard starboard, port or hard port. The left and right arrow keys switch between these commands.^^Current commands are represented by arrows around the representation of your ship in the upper right corner. Press Enter to set the sail and Backspace to get a tactical view of the scene. Try these commands to get a feeling for steering a ship and the effect of the wind.^^As soon as you get close enough to an enemy ship, boarding will commence. The ships are lashed together and the fight starts.^If you are lucky, you may capture the enemy flagship after winning the fight.^^In a sea battle where you have several ships, you can give a 'stand ground' or 'charge' command to your ships, which are assigned to the ninth 'division.' The first troops in your army list will be together with you on the flagship. The other troops will be in the remaining ships. One can change one's flagship in a port or while camping on the sea.^^With a reasonably large fleet, one may attack towns from their sea sides. To do so, simply click on the enemy port town and you will have option to attack it once you reach it without first disembarking.{***}
ip_ship_info|Ships{***}
ip_ship_info_text|Sooner or later, you'll want to invest in a ship. There are several reasons to do this. Over the long term, it is the cheapest form of sea travel. It gives you complete freedom in movement on the sea. It opens new opportunities for trading and raiding.^^On the other hand, there are downsides. First of all, a ship is expensive, and you will have to save up some money to afford one. Furthermore, a ship can carry only a limited amount of troops.^^Another important consideration is speed. With a faster ship, you will more successfully catch or flee from other ships. The speed of a ship is determined by its type and condition.^^Finally the wood used for ship construction affects its durability. While ships made of oak wood are very durable, ships made of beech wood need to be repaired more often.^^When you feel ready to buy a ship, click on 'See the ships' in the town menu of a port town or talk to the shipwright. Port towns can have up to three ships for sale, but sometimes none are available. The type and amount of ships offered changes over time. To see your ship, you can click on 'See the ships' in the town menu or walk to its pier.^^In a port, one may customize the sail of a ship or paint any ship made of oak. There is one special sail which is reserved for the ships of the player. It can be changed with a dedicated graphic editor. For further information, see the 'Your Custom Sails' folder among the files of this mod.^^Once you have a ship, the shipwright will interact with you in a different way and won't hesitate to offer advice. Shipwrights also offer to custom build ships. Better ships may require special materials that you will need to obtain and bring with you. Better ships also require more time for their construction and the more talented shipwrights in Ironborn ports. The first seven ships you have built can be named freely in the ship customization menu.^{***}
ip_wounds|Wounds{***}
ip_wounds_text|The player may receive specific, debilitating wounds in battle. Maesters in larger towns will treat these wounds for a price, after which they will heal within a few days.

ip_skills|Skills and Attributes{***}
ip_skills_text|When creating or developing a character in A World of Ice and Fire, one has to pay attention to the many skills and attributes. Skills like persuasion and leadership are essential for trading, wages, lord and lady interaction, and forced conversion. Attributes such as intelligence and charisma are also essential in these activities, but will also affect your ability to marry or lead people.^^There are three important skills for the sea: 'Sailing Master,' 'Navigation' and 'Looting.'^^One's Sailing Master level determines the amount of ships one can command. Level one allows up to two ships. Seven ships are the maximum at the Sailing Master level of four.^^The Navigation skill allows one to travel faster on the sea. It is the naval equivalent of the Pathfinding skill on land (which, by the way, will not help on the sea).^^A higher Looting skill results in a higher chance of capturing enemy ships.^{***}
