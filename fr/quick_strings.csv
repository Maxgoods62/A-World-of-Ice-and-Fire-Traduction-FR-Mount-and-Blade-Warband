Bastards of noble origin raised in the Vale are given the surname Stone. The borders of the Vale are held to be the Bite to the north, the Bay of Crabs to the south, the Mountains of the Moon and then the Riverlands to the west, and the narrow sea to the east. The Vale consists of various regions: the Vale of Arryn itself; the Mountains of the Moon; the Snakewood; the Fingers; and the islands of the Three Sisters, the Paps, and Pebble. The Vale is located on the eastern shore of Westeros, a land of fertile soil, rivers, and lakes, protected by its largely impassable Mountains of the Moon.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territ|You are in the territory of Dragonstone.^^Dragonstone is a castle located on the island of the same name at the entrance to Blackwater Bay. Located below the Dragonmont and shaped from stone to look like dragons, Dragonstone was the original seat of House Targaryen in Westeros, and had been colonized and fortified as the westernmost outpost of the Valyrian Freehold. The castle has a dark reputation. The ancient fortress was built using advanced Valyrian techniques of masonry that were lost in the Doom, causing it to look unique among all the castles in Westeros.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_kingd|You are in the kingdom of Norvos.^^Norvos, called Great Norvos by its people, is one of the nine Free Cities. The domains of Norvos stretch as far as the western bank of the Darkwash to the east and the Upper Rhoyne to the west. The Noyne is ruled by Norvoshi river galleys as far south as the ruins of Ny Sar, where she joins the Rhoyne. The city also claims dominion over the Axe upon the Shivering Sea, though the Ibbenese are known to dispute this claim, often bloodily.Norvos' climate contains sweltering summers and bitter cold winters, with harsh, cold winds, and a pale, wan sun.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territo|You are in the territory of the North.^^The north has been ruled by the Starks for thousands of years from the castle known as Winterfell. Bastards of noble origin raised in the north are given the surname Snow.  The north is vast in size. While some say it is nearly as large as the the other territories combined, in actuality it is roughly a third of the landmass controlled by the Iron Throne. The region is sparsely populated, with vast wilderness, forests, pine-covered hills and snow-capped mountains, speckled with tiny villages and holdfasts. Its climate is cold and harsh in winter and occasionally it will snow in summer.The north has two major land barriers, the Wall to the north and the Neck to the south. The north is bound on each side by major seas, the Shivering Sea to the east and the Sunset Sea to the west.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territor|You are in the territory of the Riverlands.^^The Riverlands are a central region of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, consisting of the rich, fertile, and populous areas around the three forks of the Trident and the northern Blackwater Rush. The Riverlands encompass a region of plains, forests, hills, and endless rivers, and borders on every single kingdom except Dorne.At the time of Aegon's Conquest the Riverlands and the Iron Islands were ruled by House Hoare, the Kings of the Isles and the Rivers, although native river kings ruled centuries earlier.  Because of their central position in Westeros and lack of natural boundaries, the Riverlands have been a frequent battleground. The people of the Riverlands are known as rivermen or occasionally Riverlanders, and they are a mixture of hardy warriors, peaceful fisherfolk and devout smallfolk. Their lords have a reputation for being notoriously quarrelsome, and are referred to as river lords.Noble bastards born in the Riverlands are given the surname Rivers.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territory|You are in the territory of the Reach.^^The Reach is the most fertile part of Westeros and has numerous and well-populated villages and towns. Noble bastards born in the Reach are given the surname Flowers. Here is considered the home of chivalry in Westeros. It is the place where knighthood is looked upon with the greatest reverence and esteemed the most. It is also the place where the rules to tournaments are the most stringent and managed. This region also includes several islands, including the Shield Islands near the mouth of the Mander and the Arbor south of the Whispering Sound and the Redwyne Straits. {***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdo|You are in the kingdom of Braavos.^^Braavos sprawls across a hundred islands in a vast lagoon. The Volantenes are fond of boasting that the hundred isles of Braavos can be dropped and drowned in their own harbour at the mouth of the Rhoyne.  Within the kingdom of Braavos also lies the city names Braavos, also known as Braavos of the Hundred Isles and the Secret City Additionally, Braavos is sometimes referred to as the bastard daughter of Valyria.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territory_|You are in the territory of the Iron Islands.^^The Iron Islands is an archipelago in Ironman's Bay, located in the Sunset Sea off the western coast of Westeros. Noble bastards from the Iron Islands receive the surname Pyke. The Iron Islands are home to a fierce seafaring people who call themselves the Ironborn. While some say the archipelago is named after the abundant iron ore on the islands, the ironmen claim it is instead named after their own unyielding nature. It is often said that every captain is a king aboard his own ship, so the islands are also called the land of ten thousand kings.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territory_o|You are in the territory of Dorne.^^Dorne is the hottest region of Westeros. The region is rocky, mountainous, arid and dry, and features the only desert on the continent. Dorne is bordered by the Sea of Dorne to the north, the islands known as the Stepstones to the east, and the Summer Sea to the south. Stretched between them is the mountain range known as the Red Mountains, which separates Dorne from the Stormlands to the north and the Reach to the northwest and west.There are two major passes, the Boneway and the Prince's Pass, which go through the Red Mountains to the Dornish Marches of the Stormlands. The southern coast is some four hundred leagues long. It is ridden with cliffs, whirlpools, and hidden shoals, with few safe landings.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territory_of|You are in the territory of the Nights Watch.^^The Nights Watch guard the wall which protects the realms of men. Here it is mostly cold, wet and bleak consisting of little wildlife and population.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territory_of_|You are in the territory of the Free Folk.^^The free folk occupy the land north of the Wall, also known as the lands beyond the Wall. Some free folk are little more than savage and primitive raiders, but other groups live in small, settled communities and villages. Due to the impracticality of agriculture in the far north, many of them are hunters. The lands beyond the Wall are primarily wild, untamed and uncharted. The climate is harsh and bitter, especially in the far north in the Lands of Always Winter. The region immediately north of the Wall includes the haunted forest, a vast taiga-forest which covers most of the area, extending from the Wall to the furthest lands of Thenn. While no true roads exist, numerous game trails, paths, and old stream beds, called ranger roads, are used by the Night's Watch and free folk alike.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territory_of_t|You are in the territory of the Dothraki.^^The Dothraki people are a culture of nomadic warriors in Essos who range across the vast grasslands of the Dothraki sea in hordes known as khalasars. They are large people with copper-toned skin, dark almond eyes, and black hair. The nomadic Dothraki do not have a tradition of settlements and rely heavily on raiding neighbouring nations, and each other, for subsistence. They can however erect large grass canopies for special occasions, but typically live in portable tents, always on the move. They have only one permanent city called Vaes Dothrak, which serves as their capital.Although they disdain the exchange of currency, they do give and accept gifts, often including slaves. Sometimes a strong khalasar may threaten to sack one of the Free Cities or demand tribute. They are a people to be wary of.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom|You are in the kingdom of Pentos.^^Pentos is a large port city, more populous than Astapor on Slaver's Bay. Located closest of all the Free Cities to King's Landing in Westeros, Pentos is one of the westernmost of the Free Cities. The city lies on the Bay of Pentos off the narrow sea, with the Flatlands and Velvet Hills to the east. Even though Pentos has massive, high walls, it is often regarded as the most vulnerable of the Free Cities. It was founded by merchants, traders, seafarers, and farmers from the Valyrian Freehold as a trading outpost and continues to be an important trade hub to this day. Slavery has been forbidden in Pentos since its last war with Braavos. Nonetheless, there are many servants here that are slaves in all but name.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territory_of_th|You are in the territory of the Targaryens.^^House Targaryen is a noble family of Valyrian descent, and is the only family of dragonlords who survived the Doom of Valyria. They ruled as the kings on the Iron Throne and as the Great House of the Crownlands for nearly three hundred years. House Targaryen took possession of the castle Dragonstone upon leaving Valyria. Following the Conquest, they built the Aegonfort in the capital city of King's Landing. The Aegonfort was later torn down and replaced by the Red Keep, which remained their main seat for the duration of their dynasty, and which houses the Iron Throne.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_|You are in the kingdom of Myr.^^Myr is considered to be among the most advanced of the Free Cities, and is famed for its arts and learning. Modern Myr was founded by merchant adventurers from the Valyrian Freehold after they conquered a walled Andal town. Their main exports are finished goods, such as carpets and lace. It is thought the best glass and lenses come from Myr, and lenscrafters from Myr are considered to be without equal in all the world.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_o|You are in the kingdom of Tyrosh.^^Tyrosh is a fortress city, protected by high walls, located on the northernmost and easternmost of the Stepstones. Its inner walls are fused black dragonstone. It is a mercantile city, where trade is considered a much more honourable profession than arms. Shortly after its founding, Tyrosh quickly grew out into a rich city, due to the discovery of a certain variety of sea snail. The Tyroshi are renowned for their greed.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_of|You are in the kingdom of Lorath.^^The Lorathi isles are bleak and stony, but in their waters plenty of cod, whales, and grey leviathans can be found, as well as colonies of walrus and seal. Lorath is the smallest, poorest, and least populous of the Nine Free Cities. It is located far from the trade routes, which has made it the most isolated of the Free Cities. {***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territory_of_the|You are in the territory of the Westerlands.^^The Westerlands is a region in the west of the continent of Westeros, it is not the largest, most populous, or most fertile part of the realm, but they are the richest. Full of hills and crags, the land is dotted with mines from which pour gold and silver in astonishing quantities. Before the Targaryen conquest, it was known as the Kingdom of the Rock. People from the Westerlands are known as westermen. The customary surname of bastards of noble origin born in the Westerlands is Hill.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_of_|You are in the kingdom of Lys.^^Lys, a mercantile city is built on a fertile island considered a paradise by Valyrian dragonlords. The sunny island is fertile with palm and fruit trees, and the surrounding blue-green waters are filled with fish. Protected by high walls and hired sellswords and a city dominated by wealth rather than by birth, Lys is where trade is considered a profession more honourable than arms. Lys is ruled by conclaves of magisters, chosen from amongst the wealthiest and noblest men of the city. Slaves in Lys outnumber free men three to one. More than anywhere else in the known world, the blood of Old Valyria still runs strong in the Lyseni, who are regarded as beautiful.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_kingdom_Q|You are in the kingdom Qohor.^^Qohor is also known as the City of Sorcerers. Due to its location, Qohor functions as the gateway to the Dothraki sea. Trading caravans bound for Vaes Dothrak and the lands beyond the Bone Mountains provision themselves in Qohor before heading towards the Dothraki sea. Similarly, caravans returning from the Dothraki sea arrive first at Qohor. The initial settlement of Qohor was a lumber camp along the Forest of Qohor which was colonized by followers of the Black Goat. The religious dissidents abandoned Valyria, rejecting the religious tolerance practised by the Valyrian Freehold.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_the_territory_of_V|You are in the territory of Volantis.^^Volantis, often called Old Volantis and the First Daughter is one of the greatest, richest, and most powerful of the city-states and was once the most populous. The climate of Volantis is hot and humid, the air is hot and heavy. Beyond the waterfront and its breezes the streets and alleys of Volantis are enough to drown a man in his own sweat, as least on the eastern side of the river. Heat shimmers off of the streets, giving a dreamlike quality to the surroundings.{***}
qstr_You_are_in_territory|You are in territory of the Stormlands.^^The Kingdom of the Storm was a sovereign nation until the War of Conquest, in which the last Storm King was slain. The region is so-named for the savage and frequent autumn storms that batter the coast after beginning in the Summer Sea. Although it is rainy, the region is fertile enough. There are no cities in the Stormlands due to the strong martial culture of the storm lords. Noble bastards raised in the Stormlands are given the surname Storm.{***}

qstr_...Westeros_299...|...Westeros 299...{***}
qstr_My_name_is_Samwell_T|My name is Samwell Tarly, and if you delve into this world, I recommend you listen carefully...^^Westeros. The Andals called it the Seven Kingdoms, where their ancestors killed off the Children of the Forest and pushed the First Men north past the Neck. The kingdoms are large, rich, and beautiful... as they are coveted. The kingdoms are once again at war after the death of King Robert Baratheon. Lord Eddard Stark, Hand of the King and Warden of the North discovered that King Robert's children were a product of incest between Queen Cersei Lannister and her twin brother, Ser Jaime. The Lannisters have put the insolent boy King Joffrey on the Iron Throne! After imprisoning Lord Tyrion Lannister, Lord Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, has assembled his army in the Westerlands to march on the North and their allies in the Riverlands. Ravens have been called, wolves are howling, lions are roaring, and stags are clashing.^^To the south, King Robert's younger brother, Lord Renly Baratheon has crowned himself as king. Through the marriage of Lady Margaery Tyrell, daughter of Lord Mace Tyrell, Lord of the Highgarden and Warden of the South, the Reach has allied with the King in the Stormlands to crown him ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. However, some of the lords in the Stormlands recognize his older brother, Stannis Baratheon as the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, and will not stay dormant as their fellow countrymen choose to follow a pretender while his older brother is stranded on the island of Dragonstone. ^^Past the western coast, the men of the Iron Islands, led by their self-proclaimed King Balon Greyjoy wreak havoc on the mainlanders as the kings of Westeros fight each other for the Iron Throne. Like the Northerners, the Ironborn mean to bring their country back to the Old Ways, when they ruled themselves independently from the Southern Kings. They do not deal in wealth and trade for their prosperity, they take what is theirs through raiding and raping. Iron, not gold. ^^The people of Dorne live in the southernmost region of Westeros and have always been known as being a more independent country then the other kingdoms. Lead by Prince Doran Martell, the Dornishmen have past ties to the old Targaryen kings and have often been mistreated by their northern neighbours. Dorne harbours deep mistrust of Lord Tywin Lannister for the murder of Elia Martell. His bannerman, Ser Gregor Clegane, raped and murdered Elia and killed her children during Robert Baratheon's rebellion to the Targaryen's, for she had been married to Rhaegar Targaryen. The eastern realm of Westeros, the Vale of Arryn, has stayed out of the conflict thus far. Lord Jon Arryn, prior to his death, Lord of the Eyrie and Warden of the East, was Hand of the King for Robert Baratheon before Lord Eddard Stark. Lady Lysa Arryn, his wife, remains neutral in the war for fear of her son's life, even though Lord Eddard Stark's wife, Catelyn, is her sister from the Riverlands. We shall see which direction these neutral realms decide to take. ^^Across the Narrow Sea, to the east, lies the Free Cities of Essos. Though the name sings of freedom, many of the cities rely on slavery and are not much but urban city states with a few settlements and farms where these slaves labour away. The Free Cities include Braavos, Lorath, Norvos, Qohor, Pentos, Tyrosh, Lys, Myr, and Volantis. The Dothraki horsemen have many settlements throughout Essos and have migrated into the lands of the Free Cities, they have been wreaking havoc through the western plains of Essos. ^^Past the city-states spreads a rumour of a young girl with three dragon eggs, Daenerys Targaryen. The last remaining heir of the former ruler of Westeros, the Dragon Queen seems to have her eyes set on Westeros. But those are not the only rumours of the world, it seems. ^^The Night's Watch, an order of men who guard Westeros from the Wildlings who live far north beyond the Wall have noticed a rising amount of these ravages crossing south. The Wildlings have united into an army under a former ranger of the Night's Watch, Mance Rayder, also known as the King beyond the Wall. The reason why seems to be disturbing, these Wildlings, who call themselves the Free Folk, tell stories of the dead rising, but many believe it is most likely just an excuse to get their people South for the winter. ^^^But winter is coming, as the Starks always say. The Northerners are always right, and the summer has lasted years longer than any summer in recent history. With such a long summer, comes an even longer winter. As Westeros lives in a clash of kings, this storm of swords will only bring a feast of crows, and the winds of winter will swallow the realm.{***}

qstr__VERY_IMPORTANT:_How| VERY IMPORTANT: How does the gamemode Warlords Battle work?^^1. If you are lord, then in the inventory menu you can choose the type of troop command you'd like. If you have more money than usual it's because you need to pay your troops. What does this mean? That all the money you don't spend on buying equipment will be used for wages to battlefield troops (more money = more troops). ^Each basic troop normally costs 50 coins, but if a unit is < level 21, it costs +50 coins. If a unit is < level 25, by each level it cost you +30 coins. And if a unit has horse +50 coins. Keep this in mind when designing your army. Do you prefer quantity over quality? . ^^2. If you are an elite troop no need to worry about recruiting troops, spend all your money equipping the best gear; you have to be a battle champion, someone important, so your performance in battle is essential. ^ Killing, healing allied troops, exploring the territory, taking orders from lords, is all crucial. Also, if the lords fall, the task of leading the troops will fall upon you.^^(Press K){***}

qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you were sent to live in the court of one of the nobles of the land. There, your first lessons were in humility, as you waited upon the lords and ladies of the household. But from their chess games, their gossip, even the poetry of great deeds and courtly love, you quickly began to learn about the adult world of conflict and competition. You also learned from the rough games of the other children, who battered at each other with sticks in imitation of their elders' swords.{***}
qstr_As_a_{reg3?girl:boy}_|As a {reg3?girl:boy} growing out of childhood, you apprenticed with a local craftsman to learn a trade.

When you were named squire to a noble at court, you practised long hours with weapons, learning how to deal out hard knocks and how to take them, too. You were instructed in your obligations to your lord, and of your duties to those who might one day be your vassals. But in addition to learning the chivalric ideal, you also learned about the less uplifting side -- old warriors' stories of ruthless power politics, of betrayals and usurpations, of men who used guile as well as valour to achieve their aims.{***}
qstr_{reg3?woman:man}|{reg3?woman:man}{***}
qstr_Though_the_distinctio|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. You joined the tightly-knit circle of women at court, ladies who all did proper ladylike things, the wives and mistresses of noble men as well as maidens who had yet to find a husband. However, even here you found politics at work as the ladies schemed for prominence and fought each other bitterly to catch the eye of whatever unmarried man was in fashion at court. You soon learned ways of turning these situations and goings-on to your advantage. With it came the realisation that you yourself could wield great influence in the world, if only you applied yourself with a little bit of subtlety.{***}
qstr_Though_the_distinction|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. You set out on your own with nothing except the instrument slung over your back and your own voice. It was a poor existence, with many a hungry night when people failed to appreciate your play, but you managed to survive on your music alone. As the years went by you became adept at playing the drunken crowds in your taverns, and even better at talking anyone out of anything you wanted.{***}
qstr_Though_the_distinction_|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {reg3?woman:man}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. You found yourself as a student in the university of one of the great cities, where you studied theology, philosophy, and medicine. But not all your lessons were learned in the lecture halls. You may or may not have joined in with your fellows as they roamed the alleys in search of wine, women, and a good fight. However, you certainly were able to observe how a broken jaw is set, or how an angry townsman can be persuaded to set down his club and accept cash compensation for the destruction of his shop.{***}
qstr_Though_the_distinction_f|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. Heeding the call of the open road, you travelled from village to village buying and selling what you could. It was not a rich existence, but you became a master at haggling even the most miserly elders into giving you a good price. Soon, you knew, you would be well-placed to start your own trading empire...{***}
qstr_Though_the_distinction_fe|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. You pursued a career as a smith, crafting items of function and beauty out of simple metal. As time wore on you became a master of your trade, and fine work started to fetch fine prices. With food in your belly and logs on your fire, you could take pride in your work and your growing reputation.{***}
qstr_Though_the_distinction_fel|Though the distinction felt sudden to you, somewhere along the way you had become a {s13}, and the whole world seemed to change around you. Dissatisfied with common men's desperate scrabble for coin, you took to your local lord's own forests and decided to help yourself to its bounty, laws be damned. You hunted stags, boars and geese and sold the precious meat under the table. You cut down trees right under the watchmen's noses and turned them into firewood that warmed many freezing homes during winter. All for a few silvers, of course.{***}
qstr_Only_you_know_exactl|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer.

qstr_Only_you_know_exactly_|Only you know exactly what caused you to give up your old life and become an adventurer. You're not even sure when your home became a prison, when the familiar became mundane, but your dreams of wandering have taken over your life.
